A landslide on the main highway linking Colombia's two biggest cities has killed at least six people and trapped an unknown number under tons of earth. Antioquia state rescue chief Mario Parodi says four people were rescued and hospitalized after the Wednesday morning disaster covered all four lanes of the highway linking Bogota with Medellin. Rescuers with dogs joined the search for victims. Parodi said two motorcycles, a truck and two small vehicles were buried by the slide, which covered two football fields. He said the highway would be closed for several days. Landslides are not uncommon in Colombia's rugged mountainous terrain. Source: Associated Press",0.0
