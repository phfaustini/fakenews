The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI’s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act.   “It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.”   It's silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOn's attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism. Some Dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record, Comey is as likely to hurt Hillary as he is himself.",0.0
