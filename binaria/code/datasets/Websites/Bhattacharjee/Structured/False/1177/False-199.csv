Staffan de Mistura said, in a statement, the U-N has credible reports civilians have been killed in the attacks. De Misutra blamed the militants for the attacks, calling them relentless and indiscriminate. His reaction came after at least seven civilians, including three children died in Aleppo as a result of the shelling.   Syrian media say several were also wounded amid relentless shelling by terrorists on civilian targets in Western Aleppo. Foreign-backed terrorists have stepped up attacks across Aleppo, bringing the total number of civilians killed in the past two days to over 40. The Syrian observatory for Human Rights confirmed 14 children are among the dead and another 250 civilians have been wounded in the terrorist shelling. Fighting has stepped up in Aleppo, with around 15 hundred terrorists massing around the western edges of the flashpoint city. Government forces and allied fighters have successfully managed to foil any advance by the terrorists.
