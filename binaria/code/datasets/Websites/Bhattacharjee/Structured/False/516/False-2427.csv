When I first started out on my spiritual journey it took me a while to truly appreciate the power of a crystal.   When you find a crystal that really resonates with you and that you feel really attracted to, you know you have found the right one.   For years, I chose crystals based on the written metaphysical properties and for some reason they always felt “off” to me. When I started choosing crystals based on feeling alone, that is when I truly noticed their amazing abilities.   Crystals contain a powerful energy for helping you to recharge your own vibration and connection to Spirit.   Here are 3 ways to use your crystals to recharge: Mind, Body, Spirit Recharge   Perfect for an all-over recharge for your energy, best done just before bed.   1.) Choose 3 crystals that resonate with you- one for your mind, one for your body and one for your spirit. Make sure your crystals are cleansed.   2.) Hold the physical body crystal in your hand and set your intention into the stone. Whisper what outcome or feeling you would like to create in your physical body. Hold the stone close to you as you repeat and feel your intention. Repeat this process for the mind and spirit crystals as well.   3.) After setting your intention into your crystals, sleep with them under your pillow or by your bedside.   4.) Keep your crystals close to you whenever you need an energy recharge. Positive Energy Recharge   Perfect for recharging your energy after being around a negative person or situation.   1.) Choose 2 powerful, cleansed crystals that resonate with you and place them in each hand. Gently close your hand around the crystals and breathe.   2.) As your breathe feel the energy of the crystal moving up through your arms and travelling around your entire body. Feel the beautiful, vibes of the crystal cleansing and clearing your aura and energy.   3.) Keep breathing through the cleansing until the energy of the crystal has travelled to every part of your body.   4.) Cleanse your crystals if needed after you are done. Self- Empowerment Chakra Recharge   Perfect for when you are lacking confidence in yourself.   1.) Choose one crystal that resonates with you and place it out to be charged in the sunlight for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can choose 7 crystals – one for each chakra.   2.) Once the crystal has been charged, start rubbing it between your hands to generate heat and more energy.   3.) When you feel the heat or charge of the crystal, place your hands over your root chakra or pelvis area (touch your skin not your clothes). Allow the energy to sink in to this area of your body.   4.) When you feel the energy has gone in, rub the crystal again and place it on your next chakra. Keep repeating this process until you have done all 7 chakras.   Happy recharging!",0.0
