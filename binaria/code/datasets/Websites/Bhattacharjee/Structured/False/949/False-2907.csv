McCullar   As a mix blood American, any time I hear someone in the black community use the N word in any way or form, I hear and see ignorance. When I hear someone outside the black community use it, I see nothing less than a disease spreading. It is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable. No other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves. Using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a Bullshit Juvenile excuse. Jay   Thanks for the comment my nigga Guy   Although I am not hispanic, I understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years !   You would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about, blacks and whites, including thouse who come from other Countries in South America, as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance !   We as the white race, don’t have anywhere near the market cornered, as to racial predigest and racism in general. Just ask the Jews or Palestinians about that !   We just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us, but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from ! Mr.864   She said the in N word on Facebook bet she don’t have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks N word that don’t offend us you wanna know y u don’t have to be black to be call a N word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think it’s cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are Niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world Guy   So what do you consider a white Honkey or Cracker to be ? Considering I was one who watched the original Archie Bunker and Gladys shows and thought they were great. I never liked Gov Wallace and thought what the cops did in Selma Alabama and Little Rock was just wrong ! I have always believed Mr King was right, while thinking that Sharpton and Jackson are in it just for the Money and political opportunities and believe the the BLM has done some good, but has been hijacked by out side influence, that sees political gain to be won, on the behalf of Hillary, who I think will absolutely destroy the intercity’s, by keeping herself and her kind in power, over the backs of African Americans and others, she deems deporables ! Mr.864   I’m not racist I’m jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with BLACK LIVES MATTERS . Then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them KKK if not all police is the biggest gang of America they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we don’t own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period Mr.864   Further more fuck Jessie Jackson I’m from Greenville to he ain’t did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn SC an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that Guy   Mr.864. Just about every Black Man, Woman and Child in N.& S. Carolina knows that, Justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail, in just about every Southern State, in the South, that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth !   Now we as the whites, have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist, to the point of having a Black President to make it look legit for the world to see !   What do you suppose President Putin see’s when he shakes hands with Obama, just a man or a black man ?   Personally I belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up, considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years, out of all races, including white and black !   I just don’t act upon my inherited prejudice, nor choose to pass it on to my children.   I think that is what makes the difference. Realizing it’s there, but choosing not to act on the difference, is what separates me from the others. Who, just make lip service to there ingrained predigest, while knowing full well, they don’t believe a word that comes out of there mouths !   When I see you, I see a black man, who is just as frail or strong as i am, wanting the same as I do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it !   If on the other hand, if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger, it dosen’t matter, you will be treated as such ! Mr.864   You right I never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way I see things my way I know u not racist u know I’m not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me ? Bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random? Do u think it’s right with out the proper cause Guy   No, I don’t think I want to live were you do, considering I am too damn old and set in my way’s to want to, besides I don’t think my wife is going to want to move quite yet ! My oldest son moved to Alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot, both got good jobs and doing well, even bought a house on a acre of land, for about half of what you would pay for one around one here, in the San Francisco Bay Area.   Brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about 1100 people, when I was a kid growing up here. My family have been farming for generations. The hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps, and the blacks were shown the City limit lines by the police !   My Mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named Pearly, live with us for many years durring the summers, while Mom ran the ranch. I loved her much, she was a good woman, as wide as she was tall, would read to me and my sister, and made incredible apple pies. I first meet her when I was 2 living in Richmond CA, to when we moved here in the mid 50’s, into the house my Mom built, that I still live in today. Pearly’s children came to my sisters wedding.   Now, Brentwood is a City of 50.000, I don’t recognise it any longer, but it’s core is still farming. There are black families living on my street, in houses built where there were once orchards, and going to the schools I did. I have a family I would consider white trailer trash, living in the house next door, that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties !   My attitude is, people are people. I really don’t give a damn who you are, be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me ! We can be friends and neighbors, sharing a beer at a barbecue I throw on July 4th and at Christmas, and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat !   As to the other thing you mentioned, I think about Cops being randomly nosey, asking about me because I was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood ? What fucking business is it of his ? If he asked me, I would politely tell him to go F off and then shut the hell up !f he pushed it, there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his Chief and maybe the City Counsel as well, depending on the situation ! It’s not a good idea to piss me off, cause I not only get mad, I get even too ! Mr.864   Get mad about what that’s childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women Im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad I don’t stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day I ask do u think the police was right for asking me ? In my yard I’m 33 I know right from wrong also Guy   I am a little confused, which is not hard to do.   I think you are asking me, if it was okay that, the cop’s who had stopped outside of your yard, ask you over, and question you about some white guy, who was in your yard, visiting with you ? Correct ?   If that is right ? then my answer is NO ! HELL NO !! Unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long ! And even then, there are way’s and means for the Cop’s to go about there business to conduct there investigations, with out asking people about there’s. That’s why the Detectives make the big bucks, to covertly investigate, with out shooting off the alarm bells !   For some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property, and start pumping you for information, with out any justifiable cause is against your Constatutional rights, illegal, immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge !   I know it’s done all the time, and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it.   But my point is simply to smile at him, tell him to have a nice day and walk away, you don’t ow him a thing. If he still wants to push it, then tell him you don’t have to talk to him, unless your lawyer is present ! That will usually set them running !   I see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble, because they start flapping there gums, thinking they are cool, and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in.   Cop’s know from training, how to push our buttons, and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results ! Mr.864   Yes he did I was asking u do u think he was in the right Guy   Damn Dude ! I was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you !?   It totally freaks me, that it could and would, but dosen’t really surprise me anymore that it does, considering that many City’s had “Stop & Frisk” on the books untill only recently ! But supposedly it has been done away with, according to the Court’s recent rulings. Fat chance of that really happening. Cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people, for there :Fishing For A Crime” scene.   I am sorry that it has, and wish I could do something to stop it ! Knowing that, because of the color of my skin, is probably the only reason why it doesn’t or hasn’t to me ! Except when I was a kid living in Berkeley CA, then I got hassled by the cops quite a bit, because of the hair down to my butt, they all thought I was a drugged out hippy, which a lot of the time, was true. I got slammed around by them quite a bit, shot at and gassed a few times, then arrested and served time in jail and probation, for things that now are not considered a crime anymore ! For some of the crap I use to do and the people I ran with, I am lucky to be still breathing.   Unfortunately that is the times we all live in, and certainly it is unfair to you to be victimised because of it. I hope you filed a complant against this ass hole to seek retrabutin !! Mr.864   I understand that I’ve did things in my life I’m not happy bout can’t sleep at nite the nightmare i have I jus take it one day at a time and think God I’m still breathing truth be told I almost lost my life 5 times before I was 20 and the only thing slowed me down from the streets is my first son he’s 13 now my middle son 11 and my baby boy is 6 and I have a lil girl that jus turned 1 so I thank God a lot cause I have something to live for haven’t been to a club in 15yrs it feels good to be out the streets and doing some good for a change only thing I have did to make my life complete is going back to church but I’ll go when I’m ready but I do read the Bible so there for I don’t forget where I come from I respect u and don’t know u it’s actually good we had this chat everything u told me I took that inconsideration truly I thank u I don’t know everything but I don’t mind listen Mr.864   I stop dealing drugs a few yrs ago actually until I find a job that pays 14 a hr when my ma first found out she had cancer I use to make sure I would not go home unless I had 5000 a week in my pocket to help my ma with her medical bills and medicine she fought that cancer for 10yrs right before she died 6 yrs ago I promise her I wouldn’t sale anymore and that was a promise I keep 20,000 at the end of the month I had to put in a lot of blood and tears for what I did and my ma was not proud of the blood money I was bringing into the home but when she seen what I was actually doing with my money I think she respect me to a certain degree and i accepted that sometimes she would accept nothing from me I’ve been locked up 8 times and started dealing weed,coke,guns,pills at the age of 12 honestly my ma use to beat me when she found out but I never stopped I caught my first charge at 21 by the time I was 25 I had did everything I could possibly do I think I had a good run in life I never had my father after the fact he was a big time drug dealer and him and ma got a divorce and he got on his on product and lost everything he been sober for 18 yrs he doing good but I never hated him for what he did in life actually it made me stronger I had a step dad but only he was good for is taking me fishing far talking to bout men things he did cause he didn’t know how to cause he had 6 girls but at the end of the day he raised me from the time I was 6 until he passed he was good man in his own ways and till this day I thank God for each parent I had in my life with No regrets I jus wish the world become a better place Guy   Hey ! At least you are still alive, and hopefully clean and sober, with a family that loves you ! That, is a lot more than some of the people you knew when, you were running the streets, i’ll bet. Consider yourself Mr.864 to be blessed !   Never a father figure in my life, just a strong willed, old fashioned, no nonsense Mom, who drove her father into Oakland from Brentwood everyday at the age of 13 in 1924. She introduced me to the YMCA in Oakland when I was 13. Took a lot of backpacking trips with them, to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, to visit the Havasupai Indians that lived there, hiked all over California Montana, Yellowstone, Yosemite and Europe. Backpacking and hiking, should be a mandatory class in H.S., especially to inter-city kids, who never get out and see the real world, except concrete pavement and maybe a city park !   I understand why you did, what you did, you will receive no condemnation from me for it ! Some of the people I ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of, wondering if they were at all human or not ! Hell’s Angels, and there bud’s, were some I knew and partied with, in the late 60’s while living on Telegraph Ave in Berkeley, even ran into some original Black Panthers along the way, now thouse guys were freaky and strange, always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up !   What saved me was, getting the hell out of there, moving to a small town in the mountains, finishing my college education there, later meeting a good woman, who put up with my Bs and marrying her, we have been together 43 years, produced two fine son’s, that are a joy to us. I became a small business man as owner, operator of a landscape contracting company for 35 years, first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience. Never went into farming with the family, my brother was the one who did that with my Mom, my sister has her life with her husband 40 years. But to say, I was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way, is close to the truth, sometimes I rather talk to plants than people, because it’s easer that way, and they don’t give me grief like people do.   Hey ! If you want to shoot me an email sometime, I am not against it. I can be reached at [email protected] After all, this is a open and public forum, and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result. Suit yourself. Mr.864   I’m still alive cause god showed me away.where I didn’t have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize I was only making memories in the streets.but I’ll never think I’ll live to tell a lot of people who didn’t know me my life style jus feel like before some of the White’s judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasn’t by choice that’s for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also Guy   Good to hear. Now what are you doing ? Mr.864   Doing father dutys Guy   So what ‘s that for you ? What line of work are you in, how many rug rats you got running around, your wife work or is she a stay at home mom ? What’s the town or City like you live in ! Got any hobbies, or are you sports nut’s   Just curious, is all, sure it’s none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken, if you don’t want to talk. Guy   I hope your education dose not reflect the way you write. But if it dose, god help us all, because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left, to you, so you can build onto it for the, betterment of the future generations ( your children and there children’s children ) to come ! Mr.864   As long as I graduated from high school I’m happy long as my job allow me to bring him 15 to 1600 every two weeks I’m happy my education ain’t got nothing to with how I shorten my word like everyone else in life I be willing to bet I go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didn’t know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight A students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions don’t have nothing do with how I write I’m not in school anymore I feel I shouldn’t have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids Guy   Of course you are a proud father and well you should be. Don’t we all as parents, want and expect our children to be better than we were ? I think that is only natural.   My son’s both graduated from Collage and are set in there lives, both in there early 30’s, one married and living in Alaska working as a City Planner and the other is still here at home, finishing up his education. Cheaper that way.   There mother and I din’t get past a two year community collage degree, with me going into business as a landscape contractor 35 years.   You are right, your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring. You don’t have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that, Your’s alone, and who the hell am I to criticise !?   Mr.864. You talk the way you want and feel comfortable in, and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile, if it’s okay with you. Mr.864   I like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some American u only have wisdom from being wise Hugh Culliton   Call me pre-millennial, but I find it baffling that anyone, regardless of where they think it’ll go, would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions IS A TERRIBLY STUPID THING TO DO?   In addition to unprofessional conduct, she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy. Guy   I don’t agree at all ! Or, perhaps it comes from your firm belief that, you have never done something dumb, rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive, by someone else ? Hmmm ! Hugh Culliton   On the contrary – it’s precisely BECAUSE I know that I’ve done and said dumb things, and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked, that I find it baffling that one would want such personal – and completely normal – incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded on-line.   We live in the world of total on-line, or even on-networked-computer collection of data. As a high school teacher, I deal with this every time I teach teens internet safety. That’s why I see it as being a generational trend by people who’ve grown up with their entire lives on line. Such an environment means that, while on the up-side, we can out trolls, racist LEOs and nasty pedophiles, it also means that everyone need to be very, very careful with all data and information they store on-line.   However, in this case we have someone – not acting as a private citizen – but as a uniformed representative of the state – in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public, taking personal images of a highly offensive nature. Mistake or not – it’s out there, and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer. Guy   She, and everyone else who speaks in public !   Trump has been made keenly aware of that fact, as the results of what he said 20 yrs ago, is now coming back to bite him, as well Clinton !   Thank’s for taking the time to further explain your point, and now that you have. I tend to agree with you, although I still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady, was harsh !   But considering she works in a public tax supported office, it’s to be expected. To bad she din’t have the common sense to see it ! Hill Billy",0.0
