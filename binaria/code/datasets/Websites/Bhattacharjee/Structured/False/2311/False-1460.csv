In an exclusive to The Unreal Times , Nikhil Chaudhary, one of the techies behind this ingenious proposal told us, “You know the traffic situation. By the time we cross Silk Board, the Prime Minister goes to some foreign nation, signs an agreement, posts a selfie and comes back to India. By the time we cross Marathahalli, Talgo has completed its trials of a train from Delhi to Mumbai. This was getting too much for us. Now, with UDAN, we can actually get stuck less in traffic. The government has proposed a maximum of Rs. 2500 per hour for a flight. Given that it takes us more than an hour to cross Silk Board or Marathahalli, this seems like a good move. The only problem is that the Minister says anyone with hawai chappal can now fly, but our dress code doesn’t permit hawai chappal .”   When contacted, an official of the BMTC confirmed that they had received the demand. He said, “This will require a lot of work. First we sign the papers, send to the MD, she signs it and then it goes to the minister, he signs and then it goes to the dustbin. It will take us time to process it after that.”   Meanwhile, on hearing this, Uber and Ola excitedly announced new plans for air-based taxis.   An Ola official confirmed this. Speaking to our correspondent, he said, “We have run Ola Boats in Chennai during the floods, we were planning Ola Tanks to navigate Delhi’s garbage mountains, why not go for a Helicopter? We can take off anywhere, land anywhere. We’ll charge per kilometre, per minute and of course, take-off and landing charges will be applicable. We’ll also bring back Ola Café and name it Ola Sky Café for our riders. We will run special services just to cross Silk Board and Marathahalli.   When contacted, Uber too, said that they were serious about launching such services. “We have been investing a lot into driverless cars, but have concluded that cars will get involved in accidents in no time in India, so we decided to focus only on air-based taxis. While we are still researching on it abroad, in India we will take it forward with immediate effect,” said an Uber official. “We have earlier given our Customers Helicopter rides, now we’ll give them plane rides in Bangalore city itself.” When we asked him where they’d be able to find a runway for the plane to take off from, he smiled and said, “We’ll just have to take a leaf from Nitin Gadkari’s book and use Ring Road as a runway.”",0.0
