Share on Facebook Share on Twitter   Some are interpreting radio host Joe Walsh‚Äôs Wednesday afternoon tweet as a literal call to violence following the election, while it seems the majority are electing to point and laugh instead. At least gun control crusader Piers Morgan should be OK with it, seeing as Walsh‚Äôs weapon of choice is a musket, just as the founders envisioned when they drew up the Bill of Rights. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.   On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.   You in?   ‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 @WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?   ‚Äî Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 26, 2016   Good question. There‚Äôs no need to alert the authorities, as plenty of people have already; it‚Äôll be up to the powers that be to determine if ‚Äúgrabbing my musket‚Äù constitutes a threat, or if it‚Äôs meant symbolically. (The odds that Twitter will suspend Walsh‚Äôs account look pretty good.) @WalshFreedom Didn't you get in trouble for this once before?   ‚Äî Meredith D. (@YankeeBeatCheck) October 26, 2016   At least once before. Grab your musket and meet me in North Carolina.   Time to fight the Feds.   ‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) May 9, 2016 I'M GRABBING MY MUSKET is the perfect thing to scream into an old fashioned phone that isn't plugged in It's not a great thing to tweet   ‚Äî Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) October 26, 2016   In the meantime, plenty of people aren‚Äôt exactly quivering at the image of Walsh wielding a musket ‚Äî or, as the cable networks would likely call it, an assault musket. @WalshFreedom Bless your heart.   ‚Äî Swami Buttload (@MetricButtload) October 26, 2016 ""When you're an ex-congressman, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the musket.
