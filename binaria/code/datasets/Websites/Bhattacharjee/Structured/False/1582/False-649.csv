Sunday afternoon Comey announced he had completed the investigation of 650K emails, which he started nine days ago, and that there would be no charges against Hillary Clinton.   Um, first off, it took him over a YEAR to go through 53K emails, so how the hell did he BUST through 650K so fast?   Impossible.   Next, we just learned today that Hillary had her MAID printing off classified emails for her.   And finally, the FBI said that they were 99% certain at least FIVE countries had HACKED Hillary’s ILLEGAL server.   My God, what more does a person have to do to get friggen arrested?   It’s obvious the FBI has been compromised, and James Comey is a Clinton and Obama flunky.   Twitter exploded at the news, and the cries for Comey to resign are shaking the very foundation of the social media platform using the hashtag #ComeyResign. FBI Director Comey has officially killed every ounce of integrity the FBI had left. #ComeyResign   — Boss Trump (@TrumpTheBoss) November 7, 2016 This ""news"" from Comey should only help Trump get more votes. The corruption is overwhelming & very disturbing. #ComeyResign ",0.0
