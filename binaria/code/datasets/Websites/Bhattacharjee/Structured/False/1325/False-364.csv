Via YourNewsWire   Dominion Voting Systems, the biggest voting machine owner in the United States, has been Exposed donating to the Clinton Foundation, and has close ties to George Soros.  In 2010 Dominion Voting Machines bought out the right to own the machines in 600 jurisdictions across 22 different states, according to Wikipedia.    The same company, Dominion Voting, has also been exposed donating enough money to the Clinton Foundation to make it to their online donor list. Is it any wonder voters have already started reporting that some machines are flipping their votes?  How blatant is that! Just take a look at the Clinton Foundation’s website itself.    Wow. That is just such a strange coincidence, don’t you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country. And if that is not bad enough, one of the top owners of Dominion Voting is none other than the king of corruption himself, George Soros.  But it gets even worse.   Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project.  “In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections.”  This presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations.  As we previously reported , the Democratic primaries were essentially rigged. So why wouldn’t the general U.S. election potentially be manipulated in favor of the elite’s preferred candidate? If you think this is as important of information as I do, then share this out immediately. Time is of the essence.  ",0.0
