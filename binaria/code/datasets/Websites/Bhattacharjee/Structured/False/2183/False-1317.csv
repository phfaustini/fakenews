Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month.   In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is “more progressive” than its presidential nominee.   He emphasized that he saw it as his role to “demand that the Democratic Party implement” the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be “vigorously in opposition” if Clinton attempted to abandon the platform’s progressive elements.   “The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,” Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22.   “That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,” he added.
