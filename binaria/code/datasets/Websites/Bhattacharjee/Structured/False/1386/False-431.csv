His successor, Abd al-Malik, the fifth caliph, built the better-known Dome of the Rock atop the Temple Mount in A.D. 691.   A recently studied limestone dedicatory plaque in the Nuba mosque describes the village as an endowment for the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, but what is notable is it refers to the Dome of the Rock as “the rock of the Bayt al-Maqdis” – “Holy Temple” – the literal translation of the Hebrew term used by early Muslims for the city of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount’s gold-dome shrine.   The stone bearing the inscription sits above the mosque’s niche that faces toward Mecca.   It reads: “In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, this territory, Nuba, and all its boundaries and its entire area, is an endowment to the Rock of Bayt al-Maqdis and the al-Aqsa Mosque, as it was dedicated by the Commander of the Faithful, Umar ibn al-Khattab for the glory of Allah.”",0.0
