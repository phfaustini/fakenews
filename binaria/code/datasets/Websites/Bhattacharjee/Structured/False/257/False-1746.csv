They know he’s the ONLY one who can fix the broken system.   Our vets are dying in the streets and the hallways of VA hospitals, while illegals and refugees enjoy taxpayer “freebies.”   The ONLY way this will change is by getting rid of the global liberals and voting AMERICA FIRST!   In an emotional meeting, Trump spoke to the Bay of Pigs veterans, who proudly endorsed him.   Donald reassured them all that we would “Make America Great Again.”   One vet, at the end of the clip, can be seen wiping his eyes.   He knows his country is LOST and this is the last chance to get it back.   Don’t let him down, America.   Watch the video: Truly honored to receive the first ever presidential endorsement from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. #MAGA #ImWithYou pic.twitter.com/U7xVj1ajMs   — Donald J.
