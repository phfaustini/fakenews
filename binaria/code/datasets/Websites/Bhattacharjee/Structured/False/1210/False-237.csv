Trump's victory party By Liam Miller / filmsforaction.org   Here we are. President Trump.   I’m going to say it again. The pain will stop sooner. We have to toughen ourselves up.   President Trump.   Look. I’m not surprised.   Turnout was low. Trump and Clinton each got 58 million votes and change. But it was enough to hurl Trump into office.   The polls were close; but Clinton’s supporters just haven’t been passionate enough, while Trump’s supporters are all too.   We’re looking at a bad situation. Potentially nightmarish. But we’re also looking at the one situation that can get people to start working together who might otherwise have simply continued to jockey for power. (I’m looking at you, establishment Democrats.)   Mind you. It’s still wretched. But look at it this way: now, we can deal with our racist, sexist, patriarchist history head on.   Every Sanders supporter is, deep inside, saying “I told you so”. And they’re right.   Virtually every poll had Bernie thumping Trump soundly. All the arguments people make in favor of Trump, which they seemed to think outweighed his flaws, included bucking the system. All of those people would have voted for Bernie. Someone very close to me, who had been a Republican for four decades, registered Democrat to vote for Bernie in the primary; and they voted for Trump yesterday.   Bernie was the people's candidate; independents (who now comprise 45% of the electorate) favored him 2:1. There's no doubt he would have trounced Trump; but there is also no doubt that Bernie's ideas are America's ideals. We just can't let these lunatics have their way with the country.   So look. There’s really no time to lose. Let’s get the ball rolling. The midterms are two years away; we need to win big. Trump has a Republican Congress; dear lord, the horror. There's a presidential election to win two years after that. Local elections up and down the line. And a lot of grassroots organizing, fundraising, and door-knocking to accomplish.   At least the Koch brothers and most of the establishment Republicans hate him too.   Pull together, people. We got this.
