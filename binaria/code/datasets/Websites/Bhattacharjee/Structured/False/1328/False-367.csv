Even if you dislike the Presidential choices, downticket races are important.   And an overdue note: Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week. We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time.   The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and I’ll send your coordinates to Steve. Please put “Dallas Meetup” in the subject line.   At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: he’s tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than he’d like. I volunteered that most people don’t want to question authority, and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong, or doing a superficial job.   This chart might help get traditional media loyalists to consider that reporting isn’t what it used to be   If readers have other approaches that have worked, please share them in comments.
