I just brushed it off then 5 mins later some more weird popped in outta nowhere wtf so I recorder it I have no idea why quagmire took Peter back in time so far or what it's supposed to mean. Why would going back in time cause home to that? Or am I missing something Peter: [demonic voice] I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn ! edit on 26-10-2016 by ssenerawa because: (no reason given) link That was kind of weird and random. Were they referencing anything? Probably just typical family guy but they have taken part in predictive programming and subliminal messages I am pretty sure edit on 26-10-2016 by GoShredAK because: (no reason given) Oh family guy... There are a lot of references to: a) time travel and its ramifications including multiple timelines. They even have an episode where time flows backward. b) occultic crap. There is another episode where Peter puts on noise cancelling headphones to ""be alone with my thoughts"". This is all while on a plane, and his ""innver voice"" begins babbling about blood shed and something about the dark counsel or something along those lines. c) Paranormal in general. Ghosts and spirits speaking through telelvisions etc. One of my personal favorites is when Peter talks to the t.v. as if the people on it can ""hear"" him. Ironically enough,the people on tv respond to him. To me, the show is some type of op. With american dad included. Afterall, seth macfalane was set to be on the plane that hit the north tower...talk about a splitting of timelines. Addendum: this show has a lot, and i do mean ALOT of references that resonate with my life and experiences to a very close T. edit on 26-10-2016 by OneGoal because: (no reason given)",0.0
