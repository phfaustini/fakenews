Hillary’s campaign is comprised of extremely wealthy elites who exist in an avant-garde world filled with bizarre ritualistic practices that play out like a fantastical plot out of a foreign snuff film.   From pay to play scams designed to make the Clintons wealthy to satanic rituals called Spirit Cooking to accusations of pedophilia and murder – it’s all weaved throughout the Wikileaks email drop like a tapestry of dark and sinister perversion.   In what cold be one the biggest BOMBSHELLS yet, Wikileaks reveals that analysts at an intelligence firm believe that Hillary Clinton had one-time Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster murdered – a rumor that has plagued the Clintons for decades.   The “Ron Brown” referred to in the above email is this man, Secretary of Commerce.   Notice the email states that Ron’s assassination had the “earmarks” of Hillary’s “method of disposal…” of a “talkative” secretary of commerce.   Interesting choice of words, wouldn’t you say?   That’s what led to the comment regarding Vince Foster’s murder.   Some may consider that an “off the cuff” comment.   Hardly.   And certainly not happenstance once the totality of the Foster story unfolds.   Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, just outside of Washington, D.C., on July 20, 1993.   His death was ruled a suicide, but new documents call “suicide” into question.   Serious question.   This recently uncovered evidence suggests Vince Foster did not commit suicide.   The evidence shows that he died of two gunshot wounds to the neck, and not the one wound initially reported.   The flies were discovered in the National Archives and Records Administration.   The injuries on Foster’s neck were not reported in official government documents.   At the time, the FBI said that Foster’s neck injury photos were underexposed and useless.   Many people who have studied the case and raised concerns that it was a murder cover up have become targets of Clinton and Clinton associates backlash.   But the facts remain – records indicate Foster didn’t die from one .38 caliber gunshot.   He died from TWO gunshots .   Furthermore, the second shot, on right side of his neck was made by a “small caliber” bullet hole.   This raises serious questions about Foster’s motives for suicide.   He was tied to Hillary Clinton’s roles in White House scandals at Whitewater and the White House Travel Office.   Vince Foster was one of Hillary’s closest friends, and he had intimate knowledge of these two scandals.   The theory is that Vince Foster was murdered to make sure he didn’t tell the world what he knew about President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary.   He has a reputation of being too honest, and therefore, many speculate he could no longer be trusted.   This is just ANOTHER scandal in a decades-long history of scams, secrets, and rumors or sinister wrongdoing, unethical actions, and morally corrupt behavior that follows the Clintons.   America, for the love of everything HOLY – do not welcome further corruption and degradation into the White House.   We’ve gone decades now placing unscrupulous people in power.
