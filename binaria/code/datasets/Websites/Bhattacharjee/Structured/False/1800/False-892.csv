Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-8-biggest-threats-to-humanity.html These individuals and families are the real people behind our political corruption, our planet's destruction, and our economic enslavement. It's time the world learns their names. With attention squarely focused on the criminality of politicians , particularly that of the US presidential candidates, it’s easy to overlook the people really responsible for all this chaos. Much of the US’ political landscape for over a hundred years, and arguably long before, has been controlled by a small minority of wealthy families and individuals with a specific agenda. Through political and economic machinations over the years, these groups and their minions have funded both sides of wars and profited from them. They own the corporations who pollute our planet and exploit us all.They own the banks which make us slaves to imaginary debt. They own the politicians and police forces that are meant to serve us, yet they seek to undermine us and our “democracy” at every turn. Regardless of where you live, the following people are working against all of us, seeking only to procure still more power and influence and control every aspect of our lives. It’s about time we learned their names. 1. The Rockefellers The Rockefellers are arguably one of the most evil families in American history.J.D. Rockefeller, the US’ first billionaire, was responsible for monopolizing the American Medical establishment over 75 years ago, and led the campaign to discredit other natural remedies in favor of the pharmaceutical industry he helped to create. He and his descendants later funded the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations, which used Freudian techniques to influence the opinion of the masses. Graduates of this institute went on to assume leadership roles in mainstream media, the government, and corporations. David Rockefeller is the only surviving grandson of J.D. Rockefeller, and, as such, continues his family’s dark legacy by using his incredible personal wealth. He has openly admitted that his family’s long-standing plan has been to create a one world government controlled by elites saying: “Some even believe [the Rockefellers] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’, conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I’m proud of it.” David Rockefeller has been instrumental in planning the advent of this “new world order” via his influence in the Bilderberg Group , Trilateral Commission, and the Council of Foreign Relations. 2. Henry Kissinger Henry Kissinger is a war criminal like no other , though some of his proteges – such as Hillary Clinton – have come close. Not surprisingly, he’s been one of David Rockefeller’s closest friends since 1954.Kissinger, while serving as Nixon’s Secretary of State, oversaw a bloody coup in Chile , an illegal bombing campaign in Cambodia, and millions dead in Vietnam. (Read more here ).However, because of his insider connections to the military-industrial complex, Kissinger ended up being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , a decision so outrageous that several members of the Nobel committee resigned in protest. Though Kissinger no longer serves as secretary of state, he still wields enormous influence and works as a consultant for some of the biggest names in US and international politics. He has served as a mentor to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and has been largely influential in the development of the US’ system of perpetual war.His legacy is evident in the never-ending ‘War on Terror’ , and in the extrajudicial killings of US citizens via the covert drone war. 3. Larry Summers Larry Summers may not be very well-known, but his influence has been substantial nonetheless.Summers was a key player in economic policy under Bill Clinton’s administration, serving various important positions within the US Treasury until becoming the Secretary of the Treasury in 1999. Summers, along with his mentor Robert Rubin, were responsible for deregulating the US banking system via the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, making him more responsible than any other person for the economic crisis of 2008, as well as the economic crisis we are soon to face.Not only that, Summers also conspired with a cabal of banker big-shots to deregulate the banks of the entire world. Summers and his cronies forced nearly every government in the world to sign the Financial Services Agreement, an addendum to the international trade agreements managed by the World Trade Organization. The only country that refused was Brazil, one of the few countries who avoided the worst of the 2008 crisis. Summers pushed all of this deregulation to make the bankers richer as the 2008 crisis was essentially a massive wealth transfer from the people to the bankers. With Summers still very influential in the US government, his work will only make the inequality divide in the US worse with time. 4. George Soros George Soros is one of the most notorious billionaires in the world. Soros made it rich as a currency manipulator, famously making a billion dollars in one day by initiating a British financial crisis and betting on the outcome.During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Soros was accused by the Malaysian government of bringing down the nation’s currency through his insider trading activities. He did something similar in England, prompting Thailand to call him an “economic war criminal.”Yet, Soros is more well-known for his funding of political causes, as well as his machinations that helped lead to Europe’s refugee crisis . Soros has also been accused of rigging elections as he has strong ties to several of the companies which produce electronic voting machines. Many of these Soros-funded voting machines malfunction and even switch votes. Soros also pushes for a “one world government” , and has worked to erode American sovereignty as well as the sovereignty of other nations in pursuit of that goal. 5. The Rothschilds Last but not least, we have the Rothschild family. The Rothschilds are arguably the richest family in the world and essentially own a majority of the world’s central banks – which are private institutions in most countries – as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Rothschilds’ most well-known patriarch, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, once said : “Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.” This has been the maxim of the Rothschild family ever since. The Rothschilds are also responsible for Zionism , a racist ideology opposed by many Jews , and the State of Israel, which has caused numerous wars in the Middle East in its short history and is responsible for the unbelievable suffering of the Palestinian people. ( The Rothschilds are also the founding fathers of Israel, owning about 80% of it ). With so much money and so much power, the Rothschilds have incredible amounts of influence in US and international politics, so much so that even Hillary Clinton has begged them forgiveness in leaked emails . This one family has the power to economically destroy any nation that doesn’t do what the Rothschilds want. — Reference And the list is not complete without... 6. Bill Gates (and his wife) The list of serious threats to mankind's existence is not complete without one of the world's top depopulationists: Bill Gates. He was involved in some of the most disgusting depopulation scandals of this century, yet the mainstream media continues to portray him as a savior and hero.He and his wife are responsible for pushing depopulation vaccines in developing countries, via their sick foundation: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. During a TED Talk , Bill Gates explained that the increase of CO2 volume is caused by a high number of humans being alive and breathing: ""The world today has 6.8 billion people... now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that [number] by perhaps 10 or 15%."" Their oral Polio vaccination program caused 47,500 cases of paralysis in India. ""Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated."" You can read more on the subject here . Bill Gates' ""philanthropy"" included using 30,000 Indian girls as Guinea Pigs for testing an alleged cancer vaccine. Even though the Gates foundation has the wealth to give these tribes access to clean water, sanitation services, nutrition and low stress living conditions, they instead push for HPV vaccines and call them ""well-being"" shots.The young girls, aged 9 – 15, were instructed to line up for three doses of the vaccine. As the months rolled on, the health of the 16,000 girls rapidly deteriorated. Five of the girls died shortly thereafter.In Vadodara, Gujarat, another 14,000 or more tribal children were put to the test. This time the Gates Foundation carried out their humanitarian healthcare mission by providing the HPV vaccine called Cervarix, made by Glaxo SmithKline.Instead of seeing their health improve, the tribes reported numerous, bizarre adverse events in the days, weeks and months following vaccination.Young girls in India lost weight, appetite and stamina. 16-year-old Aman Dhawan had no idea he was even signed up for the vaccine trial.Soon thereafter he began to lose weight and energy, as the life was sucked right out of him. The same problem broke out among girls in Colombia, where the same vaccine had been doled out to the young girls there.When health reporters and activists visited Andhra Pradesh, they met more than 100 young girls who were now having epileptic seizures, severe mood swings and migraine headaches.The toxins that had been deliberately injected into them caused additional health problems such as early menstruation, heavy bleeding and menstrual cramps – problems the tribes had not experienced before in such severity or magnitude.You can read more on the subject here . George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were also traced at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which has been at the eye of the Ebola storm, houses a US biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation. There, US biodefence scientists have been working on viral fevers such as Ebola for decades.A nurse who worked there broke the story that they are responsible for the EBola outbreak, but lab quickly insisted she was mentally ill. You have to wonder how a mentally ill person was considered fit to work in such a sensitive and dangerous facility. But of course, she probably was completely sane, and just fearless enough to tell the truth.You can read more on the subject here . Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now started the sterilization of Indian girls. According to Science Alert, 6,000 women have already been subjected to the anti-fertility injections and Melinda Gates is now planning to roll out the anti-fertility contraception to millions of women, according to the Hindustan Times. You can read more on the subject here .His infamous foundation is also working on developing GMO mosquitoes that will one day carry this kind of vaccines (or maybe even deadly viruses) to unsuspecting human beings. Recently, Bill Gates has pushed the population control agenda one step further: he announced the development of a remote-controlled contraceptive microchip , which can be implanted under the skin and last up to 16 years.The remote-contraception thing may sound fancy and cool at first, until you realize that the microchip can easily be implanted under the skin of millions without their knowledge and consent, and used as a population control tool. You can read more on the subject here . 7. Ted Turner Even less shy about the depopulation agenda, CNN founder Ted Turner is explaining to anyone that is willing to listen why he supports the reduction of the world's population by at least 2 billion: “We’re too many people; that’s why we have global warming.” Unfortunately for him and other fervent depopulationists, both the overpopulation myth and the man-made global warming hoax , have been repeatedly debunked. (The world's resources are not evenly distributed, hence the high number of starving people whilst, at the same time, others are trowing away more than 50% of their food. It has nothing to do with overpopulation, and everything to do with the obsolete & oppressive financial system , as well as the poor management of Earth's resources. As for the ""man made"" global warming, the sun is responsible for temperature fluctuations, just as it has been for billions of years before humans were even around. If CO2 was the cause of global warming, then stopping the mindless deforestation and starting a global campaign of reforestation would solve the problem in a very cost effective way. But because the sun — and not people — is responsible for the Earth's warming and cooling cycles, the deforestation continues and we are being taxed from all sides for using the products that are made available to us. How is this going to stop the rising levels of CO2 is eluding me, but the general population fell for the scheme and people such as Al Gore are going to become billionaires for pushing a hoax ). Ted Turner's ""one child per family policy"" could be taken more seriously if he would lead by example. But, just as Leonardo di Caprio is preaching about the importance of having a low CO2 footprint whilst traveling in private jets, Mr. Turner wants us to have a maximum of one child per family, whilst he has five children himself. Well, I guess these rules would only apply to us, the ""peasants,"" and not to the members of the ""elite."" 8. Zbigniew Brzezinski Brzezinski infamously stated that: “In earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, than physically to kill a million people” while “today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.” To the NWO, who are heavily into eugenics and depopulation, it is no big deal to kill a million people. As you can see, the members of the ruling ""elite"" talk about us like we are cattle.Their plan, as laid out in the Georgia Guidestones , is to reduce the world’s population to 500 million, which is a much “manageable” amount. You can read more on the subject here . Just like Henry Kissinger, a top architect of the New World Order , Zbigniew Brzezinski is partially responsible for spilling the blood of millions around the world.Asked in 1998 if he regrets being one of the architects who engineered the CIA-instigated battle between Afghans and Russians (which resulted in 12,000 direct deaths), he replied: “Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it?” 6 billion dollars later and a 10-year war, over a million were reported dead . I guess, being responsible for the death of over a million people gives Brzezinski a thrill. Addendum The list is far from being complete, but these eight figures are some of the most visible depopulationists of the moment. Of course, this is all part of the New World Order plan of the 13 ""elite"" families , which includes reducing the world's population by about 90%.
