The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed “bias” for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump.   Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of “sex,” but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump – getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate.   What set Gingrich off was Kelly’s mention of the leaked “sex boasts” tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals.   Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” he said.   “I’m not fascinated by sex, but I’m fascinated about sexual predators,” Kelly said.   The bias the media has against Trump – especially focusing on sex – is historic.   “This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, ” Gingrich said.   Take a look at the awesome video:",0.0
