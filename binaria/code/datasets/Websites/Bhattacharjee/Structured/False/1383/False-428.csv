In an interview with Sputnik Turkey, Yazidi soldier Newsal Haci, who serves with the Iraqi army, pointed to the inability of Daesh (ISIL/ISIS) to resist the liberation of Mosul, where he said the terrorists' combat capabilities' are already running out. He added that the Iraqi army is sweeping through territory formerly held by Daesh terrorists, and that the Iraqi forces currently need to cover just five kilometers to reach Mosul. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Yazidi fighter Newsai Heci ""We are fighting for a democratic and secular Iraq, and we intend to liberate Mosul and the Yazidi people from Daesh terrorists at all costs,"" according to Haci. The Yazidis, an indigenous ethnic group with their own religion and customs, have been routinely oppressed and even enslaved under jihadist rule. ""The jihadists' efforts are running out, and they already cannot conduct full-blow military activity, and are instead focusing on staging car bomb and trap mine explosions,"" he said. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun A Yazidi fighter taking part in the Iraqi army's operation to liberate Mosul. Haci added that it is due to the fact that Daesh can no longer fight as they did before that the terrorists started to resort to such tactics. ""We continue to move forward. To date, we have managed to kill more than 80 jihadists,"" he concluded. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Yazidi fighters taking part in the Iraqi army's operation to liberate Mosul.

Joseph Votel, commander of the Pentagon's unified command for the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told NBC. Army Lt. Gen.
