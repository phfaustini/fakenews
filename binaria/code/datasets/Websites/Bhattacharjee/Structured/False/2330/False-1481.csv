But it seems she wasn't quite prepared in terms of....anything.   When the 31-year-old actress snagged a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her work in “Up In The Air,” it made her an instant A-lister.   But while promoting her new memoir, “Scrappy Little Nobody,” on the “Ellen DeGeneres” show Wednesday, Kendrick revealed that it all happened at a time when she was totally broke:   “It was this weird combination of, like, all these great things are happening but at the same time nothing has changed.”   She describes how she had a hard time getting together a decent outfit for the Oscars:   “My stylist told me I had to wear the perfect shoes for an outfit, and because the movie isn't out yet, she said, 'Nobody really knows who you are. The shoe places don't want to loan you the shoes, so can you buy a pair of Louboutins?'” Image Credit: Simon & Schuster   Kendrick laughed as she recalled being sent to New York to promote “Up In The Air” alongside George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.   She said being broke put her in an awkward position:   ""At one point I was like, 'If we do another trip to New York can you put me up in a less nice hotel room and then I could keep some of the cash?' And they were like, 'Ew no, this is not how this works!'''

It was amazing watching him do his thing.” Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube   “Scrappy Little Nobody” is available now at bookstores, and “Trolls” comes to theaters November 4th.   ",0.0
