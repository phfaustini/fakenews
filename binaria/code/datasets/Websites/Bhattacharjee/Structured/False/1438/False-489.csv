Guys, we got one! pic.twitter.com/2hZUVxyP8K   — Black Women 4 Trump (@TallahForTrump) October 28, 2016   The pictures showed the row of downed Trump signs as well as a closeup of the specially designed trap on the first sign in the line.     The final picture was of the likely suspects pulled over a short distance away, car jacked up for a tire change.   This is probably not the wisest thing an American voter could do to show support for Donald Trump, but it’s hard to argue that the woman who chose to drive over the signs in an effort to destroy them didn’t get exactly what she deserved.   Hopefully this will teach a valuable lesson to this woman and other Trump haters out there that other people’s property is best left alone.",0.0
