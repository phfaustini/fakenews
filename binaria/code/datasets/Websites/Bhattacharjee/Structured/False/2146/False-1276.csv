He also stressed that “Russian aircraft carrier group is fully supplied with material stocks for the mission pursuit in the off-shore maritime zone in autonomous mode.”   At the same time, Konashenkov admitted that the ministry considered a possibility of specific vessels from the group calling at the Ceuta port upon consultation with the Spanish side.

The Russian embassy in Spain says that its statement was misinterpreted. There were “most diverse media interpretations of the Russian embassy’s statement… concerning the Russian naval group in the Mediterranean,” Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman of the Russian embassy in Madrid, told RT, adding that “in fact, Russian mission informed the Spanish side that Russian vessels would not stop at the Ceuta port as the plans have changed.”   “It was just a routine procedure of mutual information-sharing,” he stressed.   A barrage of harsh criticism from the NATO officials and some European politicians followed Spanish media reports that Russia’s naval battle group would make a stopover in Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar.   Ceuta, the autonomous Spanish port located on the tip of Africa’s northern coast not far from the Straits of Gibraltar, has an unresolved status within NATO. It is, however, considered EU territory. Since 2011, Spain has allowed 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave.   The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group earlier triggered a media frenzy across Europe alongside with the nervous reaction from some European countries’ military as British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships on their way through international waters.   According to the Russia’s Defense Ministry, the ships were sent to the Syrian coast to provide backup for the naval group already deployed in the area.",0.0
