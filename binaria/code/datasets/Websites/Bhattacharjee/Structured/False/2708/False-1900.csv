Within minutes, his campaign was claiming it was a Hillary supporter with a gun trying to kill their candidate.   Here’s Trump’s social media director spinning the tale: Trump social media director retweeted a tweet claiming this was an assassination attempt pic.twitter.com/TTUCH4Zbb8   — Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) November 6, 2016   Donald Trump Jr. followed suit, telling his followers on Twitter that his father had almost been assassinated. He offered zero evidence.   And, in fact, absolutely none of those details were true.

When a CNN reporter went into the crowd to try to learn more he was assaulted by feral Trumpers still amped up …   — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) November 6, 2016   There is something cultish about the way Trump’s campaign relished the idea that someone would attempt to hurt their candidate.
