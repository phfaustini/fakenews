""I bet if Donald Trump had a brick for every lie Hillary has told he could build two walls,"" she told the enthusiastic crowd in attendance.   ""As a thirteen year old even I know Hillary Clinton is working for her own success and ways to control my life, my family’s life and your lives… She wants to make it Hillary’s America… not The Peoples’ America,"" she added.   Indeed, Hillary Clinton has told about as many whoppers in her lifetime as her husband Bill, whose famous lie was ""I did not have sex with that woman, not one time.""
