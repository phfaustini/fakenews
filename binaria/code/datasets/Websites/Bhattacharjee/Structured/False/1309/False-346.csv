Griffee / November 7, 2016 / POLITICS / A focus group of 23 people put together by CBS News revealed a frightening look at what America has become – a divided nation.   Republican pollster, public opinion analyst and CBS News consultant Frank Luntz interviewed the group, and even lost it himself during the heated discussion. He came away deeply disturbed by what he saw.   Whether they were Republicans or Democrats, supporting Trump or Clinton, they were all angry. Out of the 23 people, only 3 raised their hands saying they were voting for a candidate. The others were voting just to vote against a candidate.   “When we don’t agree on the same facts, how can we possibly agree on the same solutions?” Luntz asked.   My “angry voter” focus group will be on @60Minutes tonight.   First time I’ve ever lost my composure during a group. 😳 pic.twitter.com/6vUNsSVLEb   — Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) November 6, 2016 How many of you are voting against a candidate?
