Mark Kirk (R-IL) for his U.S. Senate seat in Springfield, Illinois, Kirk mocked Duckworth’s ancestry, saying in rebuttal of her comments on the true cost of war,   “I had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.”   His remark came in response to her statement that, “My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution.
