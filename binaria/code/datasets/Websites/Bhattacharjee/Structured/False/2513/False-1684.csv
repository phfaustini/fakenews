They are teaching them to blow people up and shoot them.   These ISIS children are becoming suicide bombers and they are executing people. Many have yet to reach puberty.   Throughout history, evil has taken advantage of the innocence and pliability of children. ISIS has taken that to the extreme.   This video will tear your heart in half and make you angry at the same time.   If these children come to our shores, what do we do? How do we deal with this insanity? ISIS’ children have proven to be effective weapons. ISIS is extremely organized in the preparation of these children. The Observer reports :   While they learn the deadly art of warfare, the children are also schooled in the three Rs—readin’, ‘riting and ‘rithmetic. ISIS runs a network of schools that the children attend. A Foreign Affairs piece by Mia Bloom attests to two schools that cater to English-speaking students.   Some of the children are local, but many of them are foreigners, that is, not born and bred in Syria, Iraq or Yemen. The kids come from all over the world and the schools are set up to teach them in their native languages. They come from all over including China and Kazakhstan, from Belgium and Germany and England and the US.   They even come from Israel.   ISIS figured it out without our help. Children play a very large role in their own propaganda and recruiting materials. They also play central roles in their activity. Highly trained kids are referred to by ISIS elders as their “cubs.” These “cubs” are the crème de la crème.   We face a religion of evil. It is not a religion of peace.These men are pure evil and this latest tactic proves such. I hope those in our government are thinking of how to deal with these children if they ever reach our shores. It will not be an easy solution.",0.0
