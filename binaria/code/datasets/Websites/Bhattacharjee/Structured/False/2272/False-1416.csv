Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker.   Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she “proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victim’s mouth.”   Col. Harry Bond with Prince George’s County Police told NBC Washington Oyindasola “forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby’s mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital.”   In a news release Prince George’s County Police said the following:   “On October 24th, at about 4.10pm, the baby had been rushed to a hospital after she became unresponsive at home.   “She was pronounced dead a short time later. An autopsy on Tuesday revealed the baby’s cause of death was asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.”   “The preliminary investigation revealed the injuries to the baby occurred while in the sole care and custody of Oyindasola.”   Oyindasol is currently in police custody and is being held on $1 million bond.
