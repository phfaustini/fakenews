New York Times :   Newly discovered emails from Hillary Clintonâs private server were found after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices once shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.   The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case â one federal official said they numbered in the thousands â potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.   In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they âappear to be pertinent to the investigation.â   …   âDirector Comeyâs letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant,â said John D. Podesta, chairman of Mrs. Clintonâs campaign.   He added: âIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.â   Mrs. Clinton, arriving Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, waved at members of the media gathered on the tarmac but ignored shouted questions.   HA!   She won’t even take questions!   There was no damage control plan again – just like when she collapsed on 911!   I’m not really sure how it makes sense that Weiner would have these on his phone, or why the FBI would seize the phone of his wife because he was sending dick pics to jailbait (unless he was using her phone to send them, lel) – but I’ve always said, Weiner is a funny Jew!   I never thought he would turn-out to be this funny!   Original article follows. tfw you just lost the game   OH YES YOU READ THAT HEADLINE RIGHT, SIR.   YESSIREE DOG.   I knew James Comey was a pretty cool guy when a Negro in Congress asked him to investigate me and he was like “Yeah, dat nigga hot as a muffuggah. Watchoo want ah invesegate how much azz he be kickin in dem toobs? Get the fug outta here with that shit, dawg.”   And now: total bro confirmed.   RT :   The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clintonâs private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.   â In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent â to Clintonâs investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. â I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. â   The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesnât know how long that will take.   Stocks fell after Comeyâs announcement, CNBC reported.   More like the sky just fell.   And underneath it we see Jesus Christ himself wearing a MAGA hat, smiling like a smug Pepe and whispering “lock her up.” Yo dawg, we heard you like America. So we sent Jesus Christ himself to make sure Donald Trump gets elected.   Seriously, people. Even if you don’t necessarily believe in Christianity, you have to admit that this is some kind of divine miracle that just happened here.   Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.   âNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,â he said in a statement. âThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.â   Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September.   In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least âfour new hearingsâ after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public.   “This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,” Chaffetz said.   The new evidence points to a âquid pro quoâ arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted.   Welp.   That’s it.   It’s over.   There is just no way with an open investigation hanging over her head, and the FBI openly stating that it is so severe they have to act immediately, that she can possibly be elected.   I do understand that there is no evidence that Hillary’s own people care if she is a criminal or not when it comes to polling, but this seriously demoralizes them, making them much less likely to vote. At the same time, it is a massive morale boost to the Republicans who aren’t necessarily on the Trump Train but hate Hillary, ensuring that they’ll go out and vote.   Seriously guys. I did have my doubts. But this clears them up. We are 11 days away from the election.   And this drops.   And I guarantee Team Trump has something to drop next week. The Russian conspiracy might even be memed into reality and Putin might drop the hidden server. Assange still has something big.   We won, guys.   Honestly, I’ve got tears in my eyes right now.   God Bless America.",0.0
