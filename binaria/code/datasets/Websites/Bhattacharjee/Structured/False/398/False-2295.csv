Engineer Roy Hobbs has seemed reluctant to spend time with family members for the last decade or so, preferring to be in the shed or slumped in his chair with a can of lager and a forbidding look on his face. Son Paul Hobbs said: “Come to think of it, dad has seemed a bit pissed off since a few years after I was born. “Maybe something happened near the start of the 20th century that annoyed him. “I suppose we could ask him but that might just make it worse. I sometimes hear whistling from the shed so he seems to be okay when he’s on his own.” Hobbs’s wife Linda said: “He was quite chirpy during the 90s. He’s probably just hungry.”   Share:",0.0
