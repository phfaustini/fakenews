Sorry millennials, Team Hillary doesn’t think much of you or your taste in pop culture.   In fact in this particular email, “Michael” calls you trivial and the the things you like, “crap.”   Because nothing inspires millennials like calling them young and dumb. How do we get dumb young people to support Hillary? We get morons like @MileyCyrus & @katyperry to knock on doors! https://t.co/RbJl04WZuG pic.twitter.com/ude7XFherP   — Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 28, 2016   Enter Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and a horde of other “pop culture” icons who appeal to the young and dumb. @derekahunter @benshapiro Combine that with BJs from Madonna and the youth outreach is complete! How did we lose to this? #rhetorical   Oh yeah! Totally forgot about Madonna’s promise … oddly enough Hillary didn’t really climb all that much in the polls after that. @derekahunter @MileyCyrus @katyperry For a good laugh give both of them a civics test. 😂   — Dale Mitchell (@thurzday60) October 28, 2016   THAT would be hilarious.",0.0
