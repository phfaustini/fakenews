What do I win?   — Randy Wortinger (@randicus79) October 26, 2016 Maybe because she wants to sell music to both sides, you simpleton. @JohnGHendy @esquire   — Yes, Nick $earcy! (@yesnicksearcy) October 26, 2016 @JohnGHendy @esquire Because this is one of the most divisive elections of all time and she doesn't want to alienate 1/2 of her audience.",0.0
