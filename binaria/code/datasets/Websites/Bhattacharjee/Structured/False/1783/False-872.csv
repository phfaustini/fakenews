The suspects were arrested one day before the match which gathered over 60,000 fans.  “ISIS wants any operation that could result in the highest number of victims,” said interior ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki.  A security official, General Bassam Attiyah, said a vehicle carrying around 400 kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium. He added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the stadium’s parking lot or fans watching the match.  “Another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred,” he added, “had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium.”  He noted that the blast radius would have been something around 1,100 meters which would have covered an area of almost 800,000 square meters.
