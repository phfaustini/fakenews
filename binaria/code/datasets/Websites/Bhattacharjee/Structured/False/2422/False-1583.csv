It features vintage footage of Michelle Obama from 2008, when her husband was campaigning against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.   “One of the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like. And my view is, if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. You can’t do it,” says the First Lady in reference to Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky.   Watch:   According to The Political Insider , the Clinton camp is so concerned over the release of the 8-year-old video clip that their lawyers are sending letters threatening to sue those who air it.   On Monday, cease and desist letters were sent to WFLA-TV in Tampa, Cox Cable in Gainesville, Bright House Cable in Orlando, and WESH-TV in Orlando demanding that the stations stop airing the ad.
