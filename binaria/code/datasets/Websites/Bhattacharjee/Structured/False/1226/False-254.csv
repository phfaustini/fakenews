This weekend's Diwali celebrations all over India have caused more pollution than Chinese factories produce in a year! The WHO measured record levels of air pollution hanging above major cities and declared India an environmental catastrophe!   The Indian government refused to comment on the catastrophe fueling the idea that they purposely allowed, encouraged and perpetrated the environmental disaster to happen in the hope that it would cause a cull in their over-bloated population.   The WHO are sending scientists in to Indian's major cities to find out how many people have died after inhaling huge amounts of smoke caused by their own fireworks. Under the cover of a thick layer of smog, government bulldozers were observed cleaning up the debris, dead bodies and giving holy cows smog masks; the perfect cover-up.   Exactly how many people did not survive the celebrations is not yet clear because it will take days for the smog to disintegrate, but the Indian Government are hoping the bulldozers will do a fine job and many slums surrounding Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, etc, will be half empty when the smog disappears!   The annual celebration of suicidal firework displays will continue until the Indian Government cull the population by at least a third and proposals to engage ISIS to help in organizing future Diwali festivals has received a positive response from ISIS fighters fleeing Iraqi bombs in Mosul. ISIS fighters have been promised refuge and amnesty if they can organize mass killings in India just as good as they did in Syria and Iraq! Make Jaggedone's  ",0.0
