Clip:   — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 1, 2016   Machado said, “I was scared of him. He made fun of me, and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me I was ugly. I was massive. He called me names. He called me Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine….For years, afterward, I was sick fighting back eating disorders.”   Machado added, “It’s clear. It’s really clear that he does not respect women. He just judges us on our looks.”   It is smart to take every opportunity to remind voters that as a human being, Donald Trump has consistently behaved in public like trash. He is a man who hates women and treats more than half of the population like objects.   Having Machado introduce Clinton in Florida was also savvy politics. Trump has never demonstrated the personal restraint needed not to take the bait. Machado’s comments should cause Trump to blow up again, and throw his dire campaign even further off message.   Hillary Clinton is setting Trump with a masterful trap. No one has been better at feeding negative Trump news cycles than the candidate himself. Trump can’t resist defending himself, and Hillary Clinton is setting the Republican nominee up to open his mouth and wallow in his own sexist mud.",0.0
