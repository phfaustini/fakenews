Nothing, nada, zilch.   But she does like rap music, loves hot sauce, and Mexican food is her favorite‚Ä¶.   So, yeah, VOTE FOR HER.   Meanwhile, Trump is talking about the issues that matter to the American people. Jobs, security, the economy. Trump represents a new direction for America, where the needs of Americans are placed above foreign interests and are greedy donors and lobbyists. Hillary represents the same thing we‚Äôve got now ‚Äì a stagnant economy, global politics, and dangerous progressive ideologies. Trump is the candidate of CHANGE. Our dishonest North Korea-style government-run propaganda media whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections, says the election is OVER. Hillary has won it. So, why is Hillary on black radio shows saying rappers have ‚ÄúINFLUENCED HER‚Äù (hahaha) and going on Hispanic radio, telling everyone that Mexican food is her favorite? Sounds pretty DESPERATE To me. It‚Äôs INSULTING too. To think that minorities are so dumb that they‚Äôll vote for someone because they like a certain type of music or food. This is typical ‚ÄúClinton old school politics.‚Äù Treating minorities like dullards by pandering to them around ‚Äúvoting time‚Äù and then ignoring them the rest of the time. I believe we‚Äôre ALL beyond those silly shenanigans by this point.
