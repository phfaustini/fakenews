They care for us from the time we enter the hospital to the time we leave. They care for our loved ones during the most difficult and terrifying times of our lives. To put it simply, they save lives.   Not only that; they save multiple lives every day. Because we are so troubled by whatever issues has brought us to the hospital, we rarely think of the nearly incomprehensible amount of stress that is put upon the person caring for us. This is understandable. When we are in the hospital, we are usually at our very worst and not in the mood to care for the troubles of others.   Assuming the reader is not a nurse, put yourself in that position for a moment. Every day, the healthy, safety and livelihood of multiple individuals are in your hands. You may be overworked and heavily burdened, but you do not have the benefit of going on “cruise control” like many other professionals do some days. Any mistakes could cause serious consequences. Theresa Brown , a columnist for the The New York Times and registered nurse for over five years, may have said it best, “It’s not like being a waiter, where you have too many tables, which is stressful, but no one’s going to die if they don’t get their entree in time.”   This why it is not difficult to understand how many of America’s nurses are getting burned out. In fact, a recent survey of forty different hospital units found that over one third of nurses reported that they intend to leave their position within the next year. This is a startling concept to imagine one third of the world’s nurses quitting. In the study, they cited two main reasons for this: emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment.   One could see how they could feel emotionally exhausted, but to think that the people who dedicate their lives caring for the sick do not feel accomplished or appreciated enough? That shows that the problem may not be with the nurses, but for those around them.   So, how do we fix this? Nurse burnout is a common problem, and there are multiple ideas and schools of thought as to how we should deal with it. However, to develop a proper solution, we must first fully understand the problem and its root causes. Although we do not profess to offer one grand solution that can solve nurse burn out, we do hope to examine the problem and hopefully provide some understanding.
