Somehow this isn’t very surprising: No one wants to own approving a $1.7 billion cash transfer to terrorists. https://t.co/375cl78E5V   — Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 28, 2016   The Obama administration’s promise of “historic” levels of transparency continues to be a joke, and true to form, AG Loretta Lynch reportedly is doing her part to contribute to that legacy: BIG BREAKING: Attorney General Lynch 'Pleads Fifth' To Congress on Secret Iran 'Ransom' Payments https://t.co/GhwL3QlNqU   — Adam Kredo (@Kredo0) October 28, 2016 Our Attorney General won't tell Congress – elected representatives of the people – who approved the transfer of $1.7 billion to terrorists. https://t.co/pbHEN4G5ea   The “historic” transparency keeps on coming :   Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

It's almost as if they have something to hide. https://t.co/n9kIJKSUEW",0.0
