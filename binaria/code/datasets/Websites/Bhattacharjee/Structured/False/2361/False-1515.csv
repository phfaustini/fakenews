The only thing she didn’t were emails regarding yoga and Chelsea’s wedding.”   “We know that to be false.”   “Further, when Huma Abedin left the State Department they have to file a form of OF-109,” he continued. “It’s a separation agreement that states simply people understand when leaving government that they are maintaining no classified information, they understand their legal obligation to protect further classified information and safeguard any potential disclosures of that.”",0.0
