(Photo by AP)   At least 47 people, including women and children, have been killed and over 110 others injured in a huge bomb explosion in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.   The blast hit Shah Noorani shrine in Lasbela district on Saturday evening, Balochistan's Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said.   The shrine is located about 100 kilometers north of the port city of Karachi.

(Photo by AP)   The injured, he added, would be taken to hospitals in Lasbela, Khuzdar or Civil Hospital in Karachi as there are no medical centers available in the area.   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation.   Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off.   ""Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal (a Sufi ritual dance) here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this,"" said Nawaz Ali, the shrine's custodian.   The Daesh terror group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.   Pakistani security officials are saying the terrorist attack was in response to the killing of Jundullah chief by Pakistani police which took place in the early hours of Friday morning.   On October 24, Daesh also claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 60 people in an attack by its terrorists on a police college in Baluchistan’s provincial capital Quetta. It was one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's security forces in recent years.   In August, Daesh claimed responsibility for another attack on a gathering of mourners at a hospital in Quetta, where 70 people were killed. The attack was also claimed by Pakistani Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.   Pakistan’s restive and mineral-rich Balochistan province is rife with separatist, extremist and sectarian violence and has been the scene of several bomb and gun attacks over the past years.
