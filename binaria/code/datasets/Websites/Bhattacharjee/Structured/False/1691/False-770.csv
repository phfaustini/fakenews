Global politics have destroyed blacks.   Instead, they talk about “racism” as if black people are so unsophisticated that they can’t see truth or facts for themselves.   This professor says that black voters see the truth and are much smarter than Democrats give them credit – and they’re breaking for Trump this election.   Watch the video: This is a movement – we are the political OUTSIDERS fighting against the FAILED GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT! Join the resistance and help us fight to put America First!
