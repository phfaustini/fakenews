Not much more is known regarding the statement, although some are speculating that it may have something to do with some kind of earthquake that happened in America last night.   It is unknown if the earthquake was literal or simply a clumsy metaphor from a lazy satirist.   “Ooh Fuck,” confirmed Democrat party spokesperson, Jay Cooper.   “That’s all I have to say on the matter.
