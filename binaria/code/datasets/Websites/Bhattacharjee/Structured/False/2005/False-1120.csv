The nearly 14-minute video was released on ISIS terrorist channels on November 9 and comes from “Wilayat al-Jazirah,” northern Iraq.  Vulnerable cities in the ISIS-occupied region include “Tal ‘Afar, Al-Ba’aj, Al-‘Ayadiyyah, Al-Mahlabiyyah, Sinjar, Wardiyyah, Sanuni, Khana Sor, Ibrat al-Saghira, Al-Badi, [and] Al-Qanat.”  Prisoners can be seen kneeling on the ground in an unknown location in northern Iraq, while so-called 'cubs of the caliphate', dressed in military outfits, stand behind them wielding hand guns.  In one scene a child rants to the camera about Putin's intervention in Syria before he and a second youngster shoot their captives - who were accused of being spies - in the back of the head.

The video emerged on the same day that a senior UN official said the operation to liberate the city of Mosul marks the beginning of the end of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq.  Jan Kubis, the UN envoy for the country told the Security Council, said efforts by the Iraqi Security Forces, the Peshmerga and other allies are making steady progress in liberating the city, while seeking to minimise civilian casualties.  'This liberation operation marks the beginning of the end of the so-called `Da'esh caliphate' in Iraq,' Kubis said, using an Arabic acronym to refer to the group.
