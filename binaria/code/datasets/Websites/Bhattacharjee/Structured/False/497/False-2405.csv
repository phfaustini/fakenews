This interview produced some of the best election analysis that is on the airwaves. Among the many points discussed centered around the possibility of Clinton being indicted after winning the election but before the the Inauguration. We would have an old-fashioned Constitutional crisis.   Listen to this fascinating interview and then please circulate this widely. Make it go viral!,0.0
