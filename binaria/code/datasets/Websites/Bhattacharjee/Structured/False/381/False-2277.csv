Study reveals lunar surface features younger than assumed http://phys.org/news/2016-10-reveals-lunar-surface-features-younger.html A new study into the lunar surface contradicts the notion that cratering on the moon occurs incrementally over vast eons of time. A team of scientists studied several thousands of before and after images of the moons surface, with the visual data covering nearly a million square miles. What they found is that lunar cratering appears to occur at a rate more than 100 times faster than the standard impact model has predicted. Could electrical processes on the moon be responsible for the cratering?
