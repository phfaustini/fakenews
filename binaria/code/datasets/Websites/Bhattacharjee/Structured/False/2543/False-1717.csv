In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.”   This year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code.   In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8.   The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein.   Tax-exempt organizations like The Yale Record and the Donald J Trump Foundation must obey certain rules to keep their tax-exempt status – rules that the Trump Foundation has been flouting for its entire existence. Trump’s been using his private foundation – which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people – to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign , among other more personal purchases like a $20,000 painting of himself , in clear violation of the tax-exempt rules.   Trump’s foundation has already been suspended from operating in New York for not having the right certification to solicit donors . Such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of “charity” reveal just what kind of man Donald Trump is – a greedy narcissist with no regard for the well-being of others. So take this non-endorsement to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing tax-exempt organizations. OccupyDemocrats, however, is under no such restrictions, and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton our next president. ",0.0
