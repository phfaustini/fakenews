On the eve of the election, Meyers decided to focus this segment on how the two candidates have handled their campaigns during the final stretch. He took a few minor shots at Hillary, but the bulk of his time was spent incredulously trying to make sense out of what has gone on with Trump during the last 3 days in particular. He also shares a highly entertaining clip of President Obama’s “burns” on Trump.   While Hillary Clinton has been campaigning with mega-stars like Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump has…Scott Baio. Trump couldn’t seem to stop whining about Hillary’s celebrities all weekend, even saying how horrible and inappropriate Jay-Z’s lyrics were. Yes. This…coming from the man who inspired the newest phrase “p*ssygate” and had the likes of Ted Nugent grabbing his crotch and referencing his “blue balls” at a rally over the weekend.   After showing a clip of Trump bitching about all of these A-listers and saying he doesn’t need them or their guitars and pianos, Seth had a message for the Republican candidate:   “That’s okay, I’ve got an instrument for you Donald — the world’s smallest violin,” Meyers said. “It should be noted that with your hands, it would be a regular size violin.”   Watch the entire segment below:   Featured Image via screenshot",0.0
