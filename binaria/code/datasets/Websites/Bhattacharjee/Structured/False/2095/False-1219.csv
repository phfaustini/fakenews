One that fits the latter category centers on an exchange between Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Neera Tanden, of the hard-left Center for American Progress , concerning an apparent leak that needed — shall we say? — plugging?   The original email was from Tanden to Podesta, dated March 8, 2015 and time-stamped 4:49 p.m. Here’s the message:   Ron Fournier is a writer for National Journal. The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title “Emails May Be a Key to Addressing ‘Pay-to-Play’ Whispers at Clinton Foundation.” The article is protected by a pay wall which prevents me from providing more information, but I can tell you the subhead: “There are not two Clinton controversies. There is one big, hairy deal.”   Here is Podesta’s response, sent a half-hour later:   Eric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation.   Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia.
