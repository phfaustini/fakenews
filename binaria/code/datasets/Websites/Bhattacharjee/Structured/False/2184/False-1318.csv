The Boeing 737 reportedly “overshot” the runway. There were no reported injuries.   Pence took to Twitter to ensure the nation that he was unharmed. So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow! — Mike Pence (@mike_pence) October 28, 2016   The videos and photos of the scene were pretty striking. Clearly, the situation could have turned out much worse.
