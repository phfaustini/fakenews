That’s unsettling and smells of more “rigged favors” from Loretta Lynch.   On Friday the FBI announced they were reopening the email investigation into Hillary’s mishandling of classified information.   In a statement, the FBI said that they discovered “new emails” pertinent to the earlier investigation on “several devices.”   We now know there were 650K emails found on Huma and Anthony’s private computer.   How do you feel about the DOJ “helping” sift through the emails?   I say, HELL NO!
