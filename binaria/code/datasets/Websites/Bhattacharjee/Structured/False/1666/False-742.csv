The true heart can be hurt and wounded, but the true heart is strong, has vision, endurance and when connected to Source can draw deep resourcefulness and grace.   As a human family this is our time to claim this Earth for the true human heart. All darkne ss be gone. We claim it first and foremost within. By believing and holding steady even in when all looks lost or hopeless.   Each one of us is an anchor of love and Source energy. And by love I do not mean this wishy washy sappy love of the hallmark cards, but the fierce stand up to be counted, protector love, of the Spiritual Warrior’s heart. The love of the mother that guards her young. The love of the father that protects. The love of Source that imbues all things.   Earthly life is not eternal. In a way a play we are immersed with in which we explore and test the Soul in all sorts of circumstances. Currently the play is a very intense story of collective awakening and empowerment under a very intense set of circumstances. In this we learn about resilience and about the deeper aspects of hope.   The elections are just a vehicle via which the human empowerment story is expressing right now. Its not so much about Trump versus Clinton, but about The People versus The Evil Empire. Things are being manipulated. The game is not clean. And The People at large are beginning to see the wizard behind the curtain pulling strings in droves. Right now the wizard still has the upper hand. But the wizard is not invincible, no matter how tall he looks and how clever the slight of hand.   As usual, there are rules to creation energy. Believing something is possible is key. The strongest block to such belief is the inner wounding we all carry that predisposes to helplessness. Much of that inner wounding has been created purposefully, by design, in a society that has inbuilt fracturing and division from the earliest of ages.   But we are not our society. We are not our wounds. We our not our fears. We are the Human Soul. We are the multidimensional beauty and the radiance of our inner light spanning eons of time. We are all the star systems we have visited. And all the infinite of our transcendent experience. And we are expansion in the light of Source, within which all finds peace, as well as strength.   Humanity is often referred to in terms of its flawd-ness : “I am just human”. But out humanity is the territory of paradox. So flawed and yet so vast. So vulnerable and yet capable of the deepest inner breath. So cruel and mean at times and yet also capable of infinite nobility.   Reclaim your pure human Soul… invite Source into the human story… recharge and breathe in strength and honor, as you intend the future of the new humanity into being.   Much love, SF Source Katie Gallanti Nov. 2016 Share this:",0.0
