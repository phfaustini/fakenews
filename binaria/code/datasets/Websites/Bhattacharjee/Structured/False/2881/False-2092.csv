The former Washington diplomat rejected the idea that there are some “moderate militants” in Syria, declaring that they are all terrorists.   “ People who for ideological or religious goals want to attack innocent people and kill them in order to impose some kind of an ideology on them, I think that constitutes terrorism, ” he said.   “ And I think trying to overthrow a government of another country to achieve that purpose is terrorism, ” Jatras added.   However Jihad Mouracadeh, a political analyst from Beirut, ruled out the accusation that the US and its allies want to redeploy Daesh from Mosul into Raqqah, according to regional reports.

Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups.   The foreign-backed militancy has left millions of people homeless. According to a UN report more than 400,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict.",0.0
