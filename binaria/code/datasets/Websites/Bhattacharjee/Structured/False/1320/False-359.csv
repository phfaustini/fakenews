I had a revolver and fired at him twice.”   Though he didn’t hit the burglar with his two shots, they were more than enough to send the punk scrambling back out the broken glass door and away from what turned out to be a well-defended home.   “I missed, obviously, but I think I scared him,” Hough added, pointing to the bullet holes in his wall. “He certainly didn’t expect to see me.”   The armed homeowner used his cellphone to call the police, who responded promptly despite the raging hurricane going on around them.
