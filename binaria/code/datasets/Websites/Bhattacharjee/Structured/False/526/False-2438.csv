REUTERS/Justin Mitchell   Prominent patriot militia groups are preparing for potential unrest following the elections, while millions of Christians fast for a peaceful transition. Chris Hill, a paralegal, code named ""Bloodagent”: ""How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!"" Hill admires Trump’s promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Hill: ""This is the last chance to save America from ruin.” ""I'm surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same."" Hill on possible post-election march on DC: ""I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process.” Hill: “We've building up for this, just like the Marines. We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come."" Southern Poverty Law Center: Estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008. Three Percent Security Force draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain. Former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh: ""If Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.”   (JACKSON, GA) Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training -- and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.   ""How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah!"" asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name ""Bloodagent.""   ""Ooh-rah!"" shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend.   As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton.   They say they won't fire the first shot, but they're not planning to leave their guns at home, either.   Trump's populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul's promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ""rigged,"" and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud.   The Oath Keepers, a prominent Pro-Constitution militia force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud.   An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one member's high-powered rifle knocked down a tree.   Millions of Christians are praying and fasting for a peaceful transition following the election results on November 9th. TRUNEWS President Rick Wiles announced a 21 day fast leading up to November 8th, encouraging believers around the country to join in intercession during this dangerous period for our nation.",0.0
