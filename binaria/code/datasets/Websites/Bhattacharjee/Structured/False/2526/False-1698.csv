Here is a message from the founder of Newsbud, Sibel Edmond:   We have launched our new Kickstarter campaign, and we need your help again. We have 35 days to raise $130,000, and we know we can do it with your support!   We have taken an enormous step forward thanks to your funding of our Phase 1 campaign. Now we need your help to achieve this next step so we can continue building our 100% people-funded independent media outlet.   Please help. Make a pledge and put the word out by telling everyone in your social-media networks.   Without you, we cannot achieve our dream of a media outlet that is nonpartisan and accountable only to its viewers and to the truth. Make a donation, subscribe, and activate others. They have rendered we the people irrelevant; together, we will make them irrelevant!   Thank you for all your support,Sibel Edmond",0.0
