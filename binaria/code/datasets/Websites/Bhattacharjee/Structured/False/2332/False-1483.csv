And now America is taking its stand.  A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.

Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.  “And don’t give me this nonsense about how BLM isn’t anti-police,” he wrote. “In fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .”  Miller said the bottom line is clear.  “This poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement. No getting around it,” he wrote.

Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.  The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.  “The increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,” Gallup reported in analyzing its results.  “The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive — both politically and for their lives while they are on duty — amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,” it added.  Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.  “It’s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,” it wrote.
