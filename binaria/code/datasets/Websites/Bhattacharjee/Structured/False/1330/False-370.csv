Share on Twitter Print This Post   The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump’s DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress.   On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary Clinton’s emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast.   Unless Hillary Clinton’s emails say, “LOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll,” there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign.   The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, they’ll bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival.   For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump doesn’t exist because their new pitch to voters is, “Vote for me and I’ll bring down Hillary.”   Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground.   To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot.   The Hillary Clinton email scandal is nothing more Republican get out the vote operation to save their majorities in Congress.",0.0
