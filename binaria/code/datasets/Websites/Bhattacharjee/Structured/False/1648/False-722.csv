Is this email from March 2016 how ‘hackers’ accessed #PodestaEmails21 and others? Posted at 11:22 am on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter   Baby Boomers and the Interwebz.   Dear John and other people who have been living under a rock, Google wouldn’t send you an email called, “Someone has your password.” Likely it would be a message about a possible breach or some urgency about changing your password but they wouldn’t send you something like this.   And never, EVER EVER EVER click a link in an email, especially if it’s one you don’t recognize. Okay – is this a copy of the phishing email to Podesta on March 19? pic.twitter.com/1jqUvafUpk   — Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) October 28, 2016   A bit.ly link for you to click to change your password.   John, don’t be stupid.   Couldn’t someone in Homeland Security or the NSA or one of those other fancy Federal agencies have taken some time to tell these people the do’s and don’t of being online? *smh* @jamiedupree Actually, wait, I didn't see the bit.ly link. (and I ain't gonna fire it up to see!) Could be the phish, yeah.   Typically most people are apprehensive to click a bit.ly link from someone they KNOW, let alone some odd email from Google telling you someone has your password. Trending It's official, she's NUTS! Donna Brazile thinks Democrats can turn THIS state blue (hint: no way in Hell)   *don’t click it* @jamiedupree That's likely it… check out where the bitly link goes: https://t.co/yKjaZzCxo9 (Chrome warns the site is malicious.) pic.twitter.com/7WACDWQwfS   — Kyle Wilson (@nosliwelyk) October 28, 2016   Yikes. Shocked Kyle clicked it … hope he didn’t have anything signed in or important in that browser or app. @jamiedupree Most definitely. For many reasons. One being that google does not use @Bitly   — SETH WEATHERS (@sethweathers) October 28, 2016   Surely Podesta is like, “NOW YOU TELL ME.”   Heh. @jamiedupree Looks like 'that sort of thing',However,",0.0
