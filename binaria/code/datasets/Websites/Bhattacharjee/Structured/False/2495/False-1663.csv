In an email released by WikiLeaks , the now infamous Clinton staffer John Podesta sent a message to Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden.

Let’s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.”   Then Podesta dropped the hammer:   “Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?

Not one doc has been claimed – let alone demonstrated – to be doctored.   — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016   There’s more coming. We will have to see what comes of them, but there’s one takeaway from this: Clinton’s people have known for a long time that she was using a personal server.",0.0
