Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls:   Barnardo’s claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s].   It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted.   The report said: “There were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside.   …   Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises.   Cleveland Police said: “It was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted.” ( source )   This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.
