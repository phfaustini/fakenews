And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" https://t.co/jXc1mHi5vn — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 27, 2016 The Backstory:   Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden was going on CNN with Jake Tapper in July of 2015, where she was told she'd be shown a new poll comparing Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders and others, including Jeb Bush. While she didn't know the results of said poll, she told John Podesta (via email) that she expected it to be rough.   Podesta fired back:   “PS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee?”   To which Tanden replied:   ""Well, let's see what the poll actually says.   Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.""   Then Tanden dropped the hammer:   ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And   has that person been drawn and quartered?   Like whole thing is fucking insane.""   WikiLeaks has thus far released 33,000 Podesta emails. While the Clinton campaign has yet to confirm their accuracy, they have also not challenged their authenticity. It's been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed - let alone demonstrated - to be doctored. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016   Expect even more to come out over the next two weeks, but keep this in mind: Way back in 2015, the people at the top of the Clinton campaign were at war over the decision to let her use personal emails.   Will that continue if — or when — she returns to the White House?
