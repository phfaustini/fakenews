Hillary closed her campaign in the state, and has put in tens of millions in ad spending she never expected to need.   But on Election Day, dozens of reports of voting machine “irregularities” are coming in from across the Keystone State — every single one from Trump voters.   Black conservative Aedonis posted this video from his polling place in a Philly suburb, where his machine would not take his Trump vote : this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN   — ædonis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016   And to add insult to injury, before “ calibrating ” the machine (why wasn’t it already calibrated before the vote??), Aedonis said the poll worker tried to get him to KEEP the vote for Hillary!   And in Clinton Township, PA –outside of Pittsburgh — the same thing was reported there! Multiple Trump voters saying their machines would not let them vote for him…   Top Right News contacted Rep. Metcalfe, and the county registrar to confirm: Not a single Hillary voter has lodged a similar complaint about vote-switching .   Isn’t it funny how “mis-calibration errors” always seem to benefit the Democrats?   Donald Trump’s campaign has provided a “hotline” to report suspected election shennanigans: (844) 332-2016, or website form here .
