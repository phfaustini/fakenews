Theyâre basically teaching that if itâs an infidel, either they convert or kill them. And thatâs what theyâre doing in our country now,â he said, comparing the actions of modern Islamic nations to the expansion of Muslim influence into Europe before the Crusades.Â âIf the gun store in Florida wouldnât have sold to that man, thereâs be 40 or 50 more people alive,â he continued, referring to Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando when he opened fire in an LGBT nightclub.Â PA gun store ad: ""please no Muslims or Hillary supporters.

He also said he’d denied service to one man who told him âI hate niggers, I want a gun.âÂ Chandler said he didnât extend the same blanket ban to potential Christian customers after a series of abortion clinic bombings years ago because âhundreds of Christian preachers got up and said âthat is wrong.â” âDo you hear any Muslim clerics condemning what is going on today?â he asked. âI havenât heard one.â In 2015, designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) sued a different store in Florida ( FLORIDA GUN SUPPLY ) which declared itself a ‘Muslim Free Zone’ but the case was dismissed.",0.0
