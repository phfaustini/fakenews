This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America don’t have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour?   If you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest “economic recovery” since the Great Depression…   Last week’s GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. It’s the weakest recovery since the Great Depression – the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions.   And Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been.   So how would he fix things?   The following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trump’s plan to save the U.S. economy…   #1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class   The tax savings under Trump’s plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article …   • A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.   • A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.   • Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill.   #2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses   Under his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clinton’s plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trump’s plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return.   But where would the lost tax revenue be made up?   #3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation   For working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with.   It is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this?   #4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment   This would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit.   #5 A temporary freeze on new regulations   Red tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trump’s planned freeze on new regulations…   In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to “nearly $15,000 per U.S. household” annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it.   #6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated   In particular, Trump’s plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website … The Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPA’s Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interior’s moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work.   #7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe   Donald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following … Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations.   #8 Donald Trump’s plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry   Barack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following … Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.   #9 Trump would repeal Obamacare   Trump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs .   Not only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families.   Trump says that he would “replace” Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement.   What exactly would he replace it with?   #10 Trump’s plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve   This is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger.   Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight.   We are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this …   America’s economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession.   Workforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced.   Median real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise.   That same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time…   If we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results.   Donald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about.   Ultimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trump’s plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clinton’s plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction. More Jobs Shipped Out Of The Country: Ford Moves All Small Car Production To Mexico » trump will have an “accident”   but,but,but but ,but obammy mammy said “Donald trump will never (ever) become president”,his words ver batem.bawok also said “Donald trump will never replace me in the WH”,ominous ,disturbing words from el president,what exactly did baaaarak mean obamas red line 2.0   Obama did say trump will “never” become president,not on his watch,for him that was a” red line’,but let’s face it we all know barry’s track record when it comes to red lines lol JC Teecher   It will only happen the way the Obominable One says it will happen, “IF”, the Creator on the Throne, says it will. barry oldwater   Hopefully his changes will spur economic growth which will bring in more revenue as more jobs are created, not saying it will, just speculating that this is his plan. SnodtBlossom   he won’t be elected anonymous   Nobody is elected, they are selected. Elections are just a way to keep dumb-downed masses in check. So keep voting Lazarovic   You’re stupid, that’s why you’re anonymous. Coward too. anonymous   You must be responding out of shameful ignorance. It’s not your fault you are dumb-downed. It is ironic that you are calling me out for posting anonymously, when you are doing the same. Resorting to name calling though, really? LIZ THE SHIZ   just like in Ancient Rome election season is bread and circus , keep the masses entertained so they won’t notice they’re powerless and gullible BS1986   She’ll use that in the debate. BS1986   he wants to be coronated , all hail Trumpus Maximus ThePeanut995   You are in for a rude awakening GSOB   We all are, if either one is elected. I’ve done my research. No choice is without risk. Trump is who I’d like to see. It’s time to think outside the box.   If he gets in, perhaps in a 2nd term, the Fed Reserve get’s axed.   I can’t stop thinking big with Mr. Trump. I can’t stop thinking small with the leftist. GSOB   With more than 50% leftist population….it does look like the final nail. Alan Cecil   Bwah ha ha ha…another twist on the “trickle-down” theory. It works great…for the top 1%. hillery comin for your guns   then there’s hillery’s economic “plan”, massive across the board tax increases,massive increases in the size of gov’t,staggering draw droppin deficits,massive increases in entitlements (handouts),after all she did say she was continuing beewok obambi failed policies Mondobeyondo   I have never felt as depressed – about my own future, about the future of my friends, my family and my country- as I do at this very moment. William Lutz   Mondo I’m feeling the same way. Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day. I’ve noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis, but even more so after Obama got reelected. The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years. This downfall is inevitable. anonymous   You’re not the only one. Jerry C   Most of us felt that way almost 8 years ago. rat28   Another stupid tickle down economy by the GOP.. We should be taxing the rich . Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick .. repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years.. Bad deal from Donald Trump. libs credit card economics   yeah just let the 35 year old “kids” livin in their parents basement worry bout the 12T of red ink,and that’s just in 8 years GSOB   Which is impossible to pay off. South Texas   The stupid in your comment just burns. I’ve not met one person who is retired who has benefited from the wonders of Obummacare. Their cost went way up for less choice and service. Maybe you could go get a medical degree and offer our services for free and help out with the problem.   As for GW, another money sucking joke pushed by scum who live in opulate homes and waste more energy than any working class family. Speaking of which, how big is your home? SnodtBlossom   Sleep with Trump in 2016! BS1986   You do have your moments. LIZ THE SHIZ   oh Snotty, you just want to rub your fingers through his thick blond weave, don’t you SnodtBlossom   What I’m saying is.. If you vote for Trump and you’re single and admit to voting for him,.. a lot of women won’t want you. GSOB   Let me be blunt – God called women into spiritual leadership roles, as an exception to His design, in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God, and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church, the home and in the nation.   In no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing, but it is something God uses to shame the men into action. SnodtBlossom   Be SHAMED.. be very SHAMED G SOB LIZ THE SHIZ   and you wonder why your single LIZ THE SHIZ   but they’ll be the ugly women, not the mindless bleach blond Fox News types Satirist 1976   Michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written. You presented Trump’s solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans. Well done. This is not satire.   Trump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else. William Lutz   Replace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments. Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea. South Texas   No, the government needs to get out of looting me with a ‘savings account’ and make it free market all the way. GSOB   You don’t understand how it works. They don’t tax those dollars you put into a HSA. Orange Jean   Except that in most of them… you select a certain $$ amount each year… and if you don’t use it, you lose it. Who do you think ends up with the money then? GSOB   Don’t expect a reward for being careless. No system can sustain carelessness South Texas   Exactly my point. Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to ‘let’ me do something with my money?   I’ve never had a use for an HSA but known people who do. But hey, at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by ‘giving’ us the privilege to use our money pre-tax.   If some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector, this would be a non issue. SnodtBlossom   Hillary will win Peanut   NO SHE WON’T … HE IS NOW NECK AND NECK WITH HER AND WILL EXCEED HER… MORE STUFF ABOUT HER WILL BE COMING OUT! SnodtBlossom   How much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. it’s only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next we’ll grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery!   Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being ” The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II” and Grant “Commanding General of the United States Army” How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!!   “no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump’s casino empire in the last 30 years.” He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks it’s just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Raymond Chow   Political experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation. Cobbett   ”How much prior political experience does Trump have”   Oh yes…there’s Iraq, Libya, Syria(she was also instrumental in convincing Bill to bomb Serbia….all resounding success stories…politics just equal BS. turee60   How much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none! jonodough   you mean like the idiot obama? Mondobeyondo   If she doesn’t have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election. LIZ THE SHIZ   yup, the fix is in just watch the electoral college , your vote don’t mean squat!!! GSOB   Not yet it don’t Raymond Chow   Why do people always mention electoral college when they don’t understand what electoral college is?   When looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesn’t mean electoral college. Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state. All states in the national election are winner take all. So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college. LIZ THE SHIZ   just like super delegates, seems fishy budman   nebraska is not winner take all. each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district. GSOB   And the minimum wage will go up. And unemployment will rise, and government will spend even more. Orange Jean   … yeah, and little pink pigs will fly away from Smithfield Foods and not get turned into hams! ISA41:10   Yep! krinks   Hey Genius. A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition. A Whistle Blower for/from the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much. The more she came up with creative reasons to deny payment/coverage the higher she was promoted. GSOB   The free market is the best thing going! Because it has some level of risk, non hackers despise and envy this good system. What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people, not all. No system can. What happens if the majority are non hackers? Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry, they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone. The market then is no longer free. krinks   Weren’t you paying attention? They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment. GSOB   Appeal it then. krinks   Appeal? To who? The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no? Are you an idiot? GSOB   You sound like a confident young man. Just ignore me. Stick with your leftist ideas. Your choice. Jace Tate   the once estudious michael snider is now drowned by drivel. LIZ THE SHIZ   well he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow   When people runs out of argument or loses they start calling names which is exactly what you are. Yes, you sue or appeal your case. krinks   I explained that a big bonus follows when you tell people NO in the private industry. If you don’t understand this YES you are an IDIOT. Jerry C   Then payers should be free to leave and go to a provider who says yes in a fair market. LIZ THE SHIZ   meanwhile you die waiting for the appeal Raymond Chow   Then sue them or perhaps you didn’t sign up for the coverage. It’s like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident. joe   That’s how “insurance” works. Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors, IE banksters intended. Raymond Chow   Yes, a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries. I.e., wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where it’s lower even though I live in California. Cobbett   Why are people so obsessed with their health? Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I ”might” get ill…rather spend it on women and booze. Lillian DeVore   I think it’s more of an obsession with the pre-existing conditions people’s health. Cobbett   I had my appendix whipped out when I was 14(some time ago)…even though I’m a heavy boozer(although not now)…I Feel Fine. Why worry…what will be will be. GeneP54   He should, but he said that he wants universal healthcare. turee60   I agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world. People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better. The government doesn’t need to get into our medical. Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didn’t cost me anything. William Lutz   I agree. On one hand, some of Trump’s policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore:   1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. It’s a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He should’ve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate   Isis took the oil didn’t they William Lutz   Yeah they probably took it, but my point is that you don’t easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called “war on terror”, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please. Christopher Privett   Obama expanded Bush’s programs of surveillance, and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars. For a WALL built across their southern border. John Francis   You are right, some things don’t add up, but I’ll take him over Hillary any day of the week. I’m still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all, having a very hard time with Trump’s torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden. Jessy Scholl   Seriously, Donald Trump can’t talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot. Jace Tate   how are lower taxes going to help zero growth? How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery? Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy, you don’t think there is any fixing it. I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes. That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything, the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions. themacabre   How are higher taxes for failed government programs going to help?…we need to cut federal spending not give it more money. That’s like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack. ISA41:10   ” I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. ”   How stupid can you be?!?!? Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector (businesses and people) improves growth and the economy?   Waiting .. JC Teecher   You are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working. It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution.   When a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin, then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness.   There is a slim…very slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years, but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss.   Don’t believe it? It is in the book; the only book that matters. sister soldier   Amen and amen again. LIZ THE SHIZ   we will wind up with a one world government just like in Star Trek Next Generation , the united federation of planets GSOB   Leftist 1. A member of an ideological camp that defines socialism as a form of totalitarian secular feudalism; an advocate for the management of non-Leftist people as farm animals.   “When the Leftist tried to convince me that North Korea had the only true and just form of socialism on earth, I gave up on trying to talk rationally with him and just walked away.” Jace Tate   if you would all stop patting each other on the back you’d find the diversity among yourselves deplorable in the face of true knowledge. Jace Tate   you changed your comment you liberal demagogues. William Lutz   But I give Donald credit where it’s due. At least he is better than Hillary and not as conniving and deceiving as she is. However, I refuse to pick the least of two bad apples. GSOB   .. vizeet   Removing Obamacare and reducing Defense budget will be huge saving for US. And will be good for rest of the world…. William Lutz   Trump however, will not reduce military spending and his idea of replacing ACA is only a secret plan. SnodtBlossom   Do you think he will help you when you are homeless? GSOB   It is not the POTUS job to do that. LIZ THE SHIZ   if he has any rooms empty in his crappy hotels he can rent them to the homeless and get refunded through section 8 housing Raymond Chow   You can’t even afford to step into his hotel lobby. I don’t think they allow vagrants there. sister soldier   Didn’t the current sitting president already reduce the defense budget? My bad…. he reduced our defenses. turee60   You can’t reduce the defense budget you need to raise the defense to protect our country from terrorist! Ye Deplorable Uncucker   I would hope that after he is elected he will go after the Fed. Shut them down. Paleface   and let the treasury print the US$. that way avoiding paying interest to a private bunch of parasites. LIZ THE SHIZ   ask JFK what happens when you try to go after the fed, you can’t can you? Priszilla",0.0
