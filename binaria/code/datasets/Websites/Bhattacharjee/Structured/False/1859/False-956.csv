Because patently false climate information is so harmful to the anti-geoengineering cause , we must not look the other way when anyone pushes total disinformation on the public. Some lies are so massive and increasingly blatant that it is nearly impossible to imagine that they are still being propagated. Could a 3 day symposium pushing the ""Global warming is a hoax"" false narrative actually be carried out with a straight face while the planet is free falling into a state of total meltdown ? Are there people who would pay nearly $400 dollars to attend such a symposium and have so called "" world's top experts"" attempt to convince them that ""global warming is the biggest deception in history""? Exactly who would sponsor a ""global warming is a myth"" event? What would be their motive? The organizer of the ""Global Warming, An Inconvenient Lie"" conference is non other than Ed Griffin of ""Freedom Force International"" who seems to be running some sort of multi-level marketing program . Who is Mr. Griffin's top ""expert"" for the upcoming ""global warming is a hoax"" event? Enter ""Lord Monckton"" of Benchley.   ""Lord Monckton"" has a long resume indeed, but in reality his resume is better described as a "" wrap sheet "" which should be examined by anyone who has any notion of attending this disinformation event. Why would ""Lord Monckton"" put so much time and energy into the ""global warming is a hoax"" false narrative? Could the fact that Monckton receives funding from the fossil fuel industry have anything to do with his tireless efforts to parrot the oil industry disinformation ? Is this the same reason that ""Lord Monckton"" ardently denies the climate engineering issue in a shocking interview ? Exactly as the fossil fuel industry and the geoengineers would want him to?   Who is the second string ""expert"" in the ""global warming is a hoax"" line up? Yet another fossil fuel funded actor, Tim Ball.   Tim Ball has been called "" the lie that just won't die "" for good reason. Ball's trail of disinformation has been well documented by numerous sources . An international radio show host (Vinny Eastwood) once invited Mr. Ball to debate the geoengineering issue with me on a live radio broadcast, Mr. Ball refused. He denies the reality of the issue, as does Mr. Monckton. Individuals like Monckton and Ball are simply paid props in a rapidly disintegrating disinformation road show. There are more featured ""experts"" that are apparently pushing the ""global warming is a hoax"" disinformation, but you get the idea. Who is the star of the coming disinformation event? It's Mr. Ed Griffin.   Ed Griffin made the following statement on the record in 2013:   … the planet now is in a cooling stage…   What has happened since 2013? And was already inarguably happening for the decades before 2013? Rapidly increasing global temperatures from anthropogenic activity which of course includes climate engineering at the top of the list. Mr. Griffin is apparently already receiving emails of criticism from his followers for his ridiculously false position in regard to the state of the climate. Griffin actually just published one such message that stated "" Griffin, you've got it wrong, climate change is real "". Ed seems have been motivated to publish this criticism because he was proud of his answer to critic who had expressed justifiable concern about sea level rise submerging islands. What was Mr. Griffin's answer?   That is part of the global-warming myth. In some places….. the land is sinking…   So there you have it, there is no sea level rise, the land is just sinking. Mr. Griffin, rising sea levels are chewing away at shorelines all over the globe , so, here is a question for you, is all the land sinking? What are Mr. Griffin's views on climate engineering? That is also a very interesting narrative that is truly baffling. Apparently (according to Mr. Griffin) the grid patterns we see in the sky are just being blown into such patterns by the wind .   So what is the bottom line in regard to the state of the climate? The planet and climate system is not just warming, it is descending into a state of total meltdown with global climate engineering programs helping to fuel the overall fire. Those who have made it their mission (for whatever reason or motive) to deny the planetary meltdown, are simply toeing the line for big oil and the geoengineers .   Here is the climate reality, the Arctic is in a state of total meltdown along with the rest of the planet . Even Antarctic sea ice ( the last vestige for the global cooling false narrative) is also now at record low levels . The ""departure from normal high temperature"" map above shows the Arctic meltdown with startling clarity. The US is also experiencing record shattering heat with no end in sight.   Ice deposits are crashing around the world. Front-line film footage of the imploding ice deposits (the cryosphere) proves this fact beyond any doubt. The graph above is a shocking image of the radical decline of global sea ice. And about the front-line reality, we don't need graphs, we have front-line fim footage .   What is the bottom line? There is either the truth, or a lie. Those that are pushing the ""global warming is a hoax"" false narrative are pushing an unimaginably ridiculous lie. Why does it matter? Because credibility is critical in the battle to expose and halt climate engineering . Why is stopping climate engineering so important? Because the global weather warfare assault is mathematically the greatest and most immediate threat we face short of nuclear cataclysm. When so called ""independent"" news sources completely discredit the anti-geoengineering community by pushing completely false disinformation, bridges with the science community cannot be built. Such bridges are absolutely essential if we are to have any chance of fully exposing and halting the climate engineering insanity. Investigating the truth is our responsibility, as is sharing it.
