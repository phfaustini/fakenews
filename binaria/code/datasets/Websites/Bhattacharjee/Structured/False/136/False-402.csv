Posted at 6:41 pm on October 26, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter   Vladimir Putin might have popularized the shirtless-on-horseback calendar pose that was echoed recently by Alex Jones , but Jesse Jackson deserves credit for at least one thing: he chose to keep his shirt on Wednesday when he rode up to the front lines of a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline.   ‚Äî Marisa Villarreal (@marisa_villarr) October 26, 2016 Proud to stand with the Sioux Indians today in North Dakota. #StandingWithStandingRock pic.twitter.com/0dPbDk6RJD   ‚Äî Rev Jesse Jackson Sr (@RevJJackson) October 26, 2016 Jesse Jackson on the frontline with that native bling #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/QevCYFugN3   ‚Äî Ruth Hopkins (@RuthHHopkins) October 26, 2016   Seen standing with Jackson (literally; check over his shoulder above) was ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù actor Mark Ruffalo, who offered his own exclusive scoop of sorts by confirming that climate crusader Leonardo DiCaprio would be stopping by Thursday, assuming his green-friendly private jet that runs on unicorn tears isn‚Äôt delayed. This is happening! #noDapl ! Rev. Jesse Jackson calls @POTUS from #StandingRock ! Mark Ruffalo confirms Leonardo DiCaprio comes tomorrow pic.twitter.com/6b2Gd8FFpd   ‚Äî Asani Isapoet (@Asani) October 26, 2016   President Obama seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the pipeline. The Seattle Times reports that the administration asked Energy Transfer Partners for a second time Tuesday to voluntarily cease construction, to no avail. And Hillary? No one‚Äôs even sure yet where she really stands on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but a few of Ruffalo‚Äôs fans aren‚Äôt happy that he‚Äôs now with her, sort of. Please please please. This is is worth getting out and voting for.
