So if you’re a comedian and you want to be successful- don’t bring politics into your act! Seriously, it just kills the mood, no one will be up to laughing after you insult them over who they are supporting for President, or whether or not they view abortion as murder.   Who would find any humor in that?   This should be common sense, but for Amy Schumer …twas not. Now she’s learning the hard way, what many of us were warning her about for a while now!   According to AdWeek, Budweiser came in under expected profits in their third quarter, prompting the company to pull the Schumer ads ahead of schedule. The ads themselves were not at all doing well, and the last one received such negative attention on YouTube that it currently has more than 1,900 “thumbs down,” compared to only 300 “thumbs up.”   Fox News reported that, at one time, the YouTube video had comments disabled, but that has since been changed. Many comments are negative toward Schumer herself, who has recently been in traveling around promoting feminist ideals and social justice causes.   Schumer’s attitude on politics has alienated many people over the past few years, however. Many would say that the comedian’s negative views on men, and hypocritical outrage, is often in complete contrast with inclusivity. This could have further attributed to the decline in Bud Light’s sales, as having a wildly unpopular figure represent your product will devalue it to the public.   Sorry Schumer. Either be a comedian, or a social justice warrior…the two however, do not play well together. Somewhere along the line you got that very obvious truth, twisted. Related Items",0.0
