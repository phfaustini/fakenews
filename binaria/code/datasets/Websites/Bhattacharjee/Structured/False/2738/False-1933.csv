Stefanovitch   Which is WAY better than the witch hunts in the much more glorious Dark Ages. You know. When ignorance prevailed, and pain and suffering were the MD solutions of the day? Kind of like how people who oppose the legalization of MJ are not NEARLY so concerned about the harm bestowed on society by alcohol and prescription pharmaceuticals. Vincent D’Emidio   During the 1970s, the “Archie Bunkers” of society were losing, and it appeared that they were beginning to accept the World as it was turning out…as a Liberated society. Then, in 1980, after President Carter’s disastrous handling of the Iranian Hostage Crisis , The majority voted for Reagan as President elect. However, unknown to many of his supporters at the time, Reagan, and his bible-thumping fellow travelers had a different idea. Not only would they be tough on a foreign-policy level, they ACTUALLY thought that they could turn back the clock on Social issues, and reverse all of the advancements that were instituted during the 1960s and 70s. Ronnie came to Washington, and brought along his bible-banging butt-buddies, and they proceeded to undo all of the progress we had made. Thanks to the Democrats acting like jellyfish, they re-instituted the War on the American People — oops! I meant, the “War on”, ahem, “Drugs”— no, actually, I truly meant the TRUE, liberated American people. In doing so, they STOPPED progress in the Marijuana legalization area. Thank the TRUE God (the one that I pray to) that the American people never really bought all of the Republicans’ horror stories about herb, and we are finally returning to the path we were on during the 70s. tom browne   carter did not handle the crisis disastrously. the secret govt made a deal known as the “October Surprise”– the only way you could know that was by being there and you were not. the entire country went down after the 70’s as the secret govt sucked so much money out that homelessness became a fixture. govts today can not afford to fix road so much money is being absconded. we can’t afford a govt we cant control. flydon1954   Free Country but lawyers cannot even speak the words Jury Nullification in court ( If I remember right ,there is one State they can ) if they do the Judge will hold them in contempt . Think about that , a LAW on the books that THE COURT SYSTEM are withholding for Juries . The system has taken the rights of the people to know that law , WHY ? If there is a juror on a trial that knows this law they can inform the rest of the jurors of the law (JURY NULLIFICATION) and even though your found guilty of the crime the jury can set them free . Please inform every person you know of this law , post it on all your social media sites , the more Americans who become aware of it , the more we can go against punishments that are outrageous for the crime .There are thousands and thousands in jails across the country for nothing more then using or growing their own medicine . STOP THE TRYANNY ! Jake Seilman   That her former physician flew all the way from Maine for her defense makes him a hero in my eyes. Sending you a mental hug Dr. Dustin Sulak!
