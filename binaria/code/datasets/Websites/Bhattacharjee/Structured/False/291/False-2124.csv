FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened  — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016     Stocks fell after Comey’s announcement, CNBC reported.  Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.  “Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,” he said in a statement. “The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.”   Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September.    In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least “four new hearings” after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public.  “This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,” Chaffetz said.  The new evidence points to a “quid pro quo” arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted.  DEVELOPING — DETAILS TO FOLLOW  Source: RT News   ",0.0
