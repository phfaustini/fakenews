ABOUT FILM   FIRST CONTACT is a unique documentary, narrated by Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe winning actor JAMES WOODS, that tells the true story of Darryl Anka’s UFO encounters that led him to channel an extraterrestrial being known as BASHAR, who delivers messages to prepare Earth for contact with another civilization.   The film not only explores the potential positive impact of ET contact on our society, but also demystifies channeling, the medium through which Darryl is able to communicate with the inter-dimensional being.   FIRST CONTACT will not only astound viewers with starting eyewitness accounts and scientific evidence, but the film also explores many of the questions we’ve been asking for millennia: Why are we here? What’s the nature of existence? Where are we headed?   Bashar answers these questions via channeling and, accompanied by state-of- the-art graphics, explains how the universe works and how each person creates the reality they experience.   Over the past three decades, thousands of individuals around the globe have listened to Bashar’s messages and have had the opportunity to apply these principles in their lives and create the reality that they desire.   FIRST CONTACT proposes that we are not alone and that Truth is Stranger Than Fiction. Share: Rate:",0.0
