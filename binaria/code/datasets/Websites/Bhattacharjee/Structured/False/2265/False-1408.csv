In a split 5-3 decision, the justices voted to reinstate the drug-related convictions of Joseph Edward Strieff. In the case of Strieff, he was illegally detained during a “concededly unconstitutional detention,” which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle.   In Strieff’s case, a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him. But the judge ruled that Strieff’s subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search — implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just. The Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial, but, in a moment of logic, the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision. The Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented “a gap of substantial significance” in terms of prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues, and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to “substantially different conclusions” regarding search and seizure law.   The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress “fruit of the poisonous tree”— that is, evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment. The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law.   However, thanks to Monday’s ruling by the Supreme Court, that is exactly what will happen now. Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals — just so long as they find evidence of a ‘crime.’   On Monday, the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015, was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state.   Given the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs, the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling.   As if breaking the law wasn’t enough, prior to this ruling, p olice were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws they’re tasked with enforcing, thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v. North Carolina .   In the Heien case, the Supreme Court ruled a “police officer’s reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.” A motorist’s broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop — during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle.   But in North Carolina, a broken tail light wasn’t illegal, thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop — nor the arrests stemming from it, lawyers argued, because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures.   However, the Supreme Court ruled the officer’s ignorance of the law essentially didn’t matter — effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they ‘reasonably’ believe the cause for the stop is legal. Plainly, police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law.   Now, in U.S. v Shelton Barnes et. al. — a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed — even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power, and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial.   On Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs. Edward Joseph Strieff, is a blow to constitutional rights.   “The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer’s violation of your Fourth Amendment rights,” Sotomayor wrote.   Sotomayor’s dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan.   Now, police need not understand the law, or even abide by the law — to enforce the law. In what world is this considered acceptable? Share   yeah we’re fucked and here comes the revolution! kiljoy616   True that many will be screwed but there will be no revolution, best to learn how to navigate this new world you live in. Gene   U …….sheep, there’s an actual revolution going on right now, it’s just not televised so sheep like you stay ignorant. Wolf-PAC.com is a Constitutional amendment, by the American people, to get the money out of politics. To end the oligarchy. 4 states have already passed it, 11 more to go. Pay attention sheep, they got you by the balls. Even this site is ignoring it, makes me wonder. ThomasJefferson   LMAO! Do you REALLY think that will make any difference? Hell, there’s a a couple of movements that actually, if they were to be carried through with, would go further toward fixing the problem, but some of the state reps that have pledged their support are the very ones that are a MAJOR part of the problem!. Tabbytha   I seriously doubt they will succeed in the long run. Sheep.   What’s good for the goose is good for the gander Greg Geitner   copsucker is a term used to describe a spineless animal that believes law enforcement should always be obeyed. ThomasJefferson   People don’t have the balls to revolt anymore! Theyr cross their fingers and HOPE, that the sh*t dont hit the fan in their own little world. The REALLY stupid ones think it will never happen to them, ether because of some false sense of superiority, or because they think that so long as they keep their nose planted firmly in their Master’s Ass,that nothing bad will come to them via “The Pigs” Nothing but dumb luck can save ANYONE from the Gestapo now. LexRex Mann   Are you organizing an overthrow? Email me. Jude Rene Montarsi   http://www.garynorth.com/public/12619print.cfm Gene   Could you provide links? Sometimes you go off the rails with your propaganda. Like the story of the DEA declassifying cannabis, they came out and said that wasn’t true. I do my own research, guess I’m whining for convenience. Richard Brooks   http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/supreme-court-refines-rules-governing-police-conduct avelworldcreator   Here’s the problem. They guy already had a warrant even if the officer hadn’t used that fact in the stop and search. Sadly the Court has said such pre-existing circumstances can cover a multitude of ills. In short he had grounds to do an arrest and a search already even if he wasn’t aware of their existence. It’s bullshit, but there it is. Betty Anne Emery Rubendall   Do you mean, if cop had run his tags, the warrant would have shown? I wonder why he didn’t. avelworldcreator   Doesn’t sound like the cop in this case was bright enough to follow procedure or, more likely, he didn’t care and just wanted to fuck with someone. Even more likely it was a combination of both. He simply got “lucky”. William Keen   In “Obama’s World” of course!   But, what difference does any of this make? YOU act like “Executive Orders” are valid! This website quotes them as being Lawful Orders just because a POtuS signs them.   Obviously, the Constitution for the United States of America has no meaning anywhere anymore. It doesn’t matter which Amendment you ignore when the On-The-Street, Militarily Trained and equipped cop is ignorant of the law in their jurisdiction and the courts allow that!   Take out the Kings-of-Corruption (US Supreme Court), the BAR Association (13th Amendment violation) and the local goons and let’s START OVER! ThomasJefferson   What an IDIOT!!! Dude, the ground work was laid for this trashing of the constitution by Ronald Reagan. And NOW idiots, think that DUMP is the answer! For all the good a president can do, people better wake up and vote Libertarian, Gary Johnson!. Any thing else is another MAJOR blow to the constitution. In fact, its probably trashed beyond anything less than a revolution will fix already! LexRex Mann   Why call him an idiot? He never mentions Trump. You are the one taken in by the fraud of election. Don’t you get it? Voting is a waste of time! Who counts the votes? Why is it done in secret? Do you really trust them to count votes accurately? Again: “Take out the Kings-of-Corruption (US Supreme Court), the BAR Association (13th Amendment violation) and the local goons and let’s START OVER!” ThomasJefferson   Nope, he doesn’t mention mention Trump! The comment wasn’t aimed at him per se. I’m so used to reading comments from the sheeple that are guzzling Dump Kool-aid, it was I suppose what is known in military parlance as a preemptive strike. While I agree with you in theory, 100%, for the moment, I think the vote thing for what it’s worth, (if enough people would break the chains that bind their minds, and vote contrary to programming,) would upset the proverbial apple-cart. Hell, a liberty leaning candidate may not become president, but enough people might wake up to the very facts you made mention of and at last begin a meaningful revolt. Sorry I can’t condense where this could lead and don’tr really have the time at the moment to follow through with his concept but you’re a sharp guy, just think what a little enlightenment, and the motivation of people of real action could accomplish. It’s how AMERICA ,came into existence to begin with. The Federal Farmer   Yes, start over because we *need* a government, right? How about we just dissolve the federal government and replace it (again) with 50 individual sovereign governments…to start with. jonn   So the SCOTUS has to protect cops over protecting The Constitution or American Citizens because cops are too stupid to understand The Constitution or local laws? vera4576   I currently make close to 6.000-8.000 bucks /month from freelancing at home. Those who are looking to complete simple online work for 2-5 h a day at your house and get valuable paycheck while doing it… Then this work opportunity is for you… http://ow.ly/9Dxq300yJFs gininitaly   That’s because the goal is a police state here and everywhere else, ruled by the new world order of fascists.. the int’l central bankers/mega corporate/military industrial complex cabal of psychopaths who have manipulated and bought themselves into this position. This is what monopoly capitalism evolves to… the unquenchable desire for money and power at any cost to the human race. They should all be hung on the White House steps. Our days are numbered, unless we rise up. jonn   I don’t think real Americans are going to let this Country fall completely into a police state. I believe there will be a event so horrific by the govt that the “million man march” will happen and these elected officials will be dragged out of their ivory towers and be tarred and feathered and run out of town. Too many normal Americans, too many veterans, too many freedom loving people for the govt to completely control. gininitaly   Knock wood…. altho I’ve been waiting 10 long years watching our former rights disappear one after another… and still too many are sparring with the illusions of enemies manufactured for us, instead the real ones right here in the highest seats of our government. LexRex Mann   Exactly– even as “truthers” gow in numbers, we become divided by things like whether the earth is flat, whether to “vote” for Sanders or Trump, whether to hate Muslims or not, etc., etc., etc. They’ll have us killing each other before we get to the steps of Congress. We’ve been divided and conquered. I keep telling people posting these memes on facebook to forget differences like these and stay focused on the real enemy, but sadly not many seem to be listening. gininitaly   Absolutely!!! I do the same and see as you have that that insidious flat screen in everyones homes is the grand distractor and brain washer par excellence… which is why 6 companies own 90% of the media all preaching, fear, fake enemies and outright lies. But too many are still in denial since Sept. 11, 2001 as if the obvious didn’t really happen as they’ve been told it did, that somehow America will just bounce back and be itself again…. Foolish pipe dream… and dangerous one that will enslave us, that noose is tightening everyday as this article just proved.   As Hitler said: “If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.”   So a war mongering, murdering Imperialist gov that created terror in the first place and has now allowed our police to terrorize it’s own citizens… by throwing a traitorous SCOTUS into the mix, whittling whittling away at our former Constitutional protections and what do you get? National and global chaos like America has never witnessed in it’s short but intense life. Fiona Clark   I couldn’t have said it better myself. People are waking up but way to slowly. Does something actually have to hit them in the face before they can see it. Joseph Edward Bodden   I voted for Bernie. They said I would be wasting my vote. But please explain to me how my failing to vote for the only decent candidate and voting instead for a choice of nutter or criminal is NOT wasting my vote? And how did the DNC get the power to rule out Bernie as a candidate? I cannot find it in the Constitution… BanishedJester   “Real” Americans already allowed the full insertion of the police state when we allowed the government to form SWAT teams and then to use them to break into peoples’ homes for allegedly using plants. Plants! We are already fucked and it is time for us to begin dealing with the treason that abounds. Cops, lawyers, judges, legislatures should all hang for what we have allowed them to do. Nothing will change with any less effort. Nunya   They don’t have to know or follow the laws, it is called law EFORCEMENT. Just do that… Frank Welsh   Utah’s Supreme Court is an Administrative Branch, the real Common Law Supreme Court is in Pennsylvania. Betty Anne Emery Rubendall   And every time they rule in favor of the PLEBS, new laws are written. I despise living here!!   A minor traffic warrant is cause for a search? Bullshit! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sonia-sotomayor-police_us_57680301e4b0fbbc8beaf4ae anarchyst   For solutions to curtail the police state, obtain and read “Unintended Consequences” by John Ross. This book is a history lesson, a technical manual and a “how to” book on how to take back our government. When this book first came out, sellers of this book were routinely harassed by FBI, ATF, DEA and other “alphabet agency” enforcers. Sorta tells you something about the contents… Philip Tomlins   Thank Fuck I don’t live there, were fucked up here, but at least we the people have some control. Steve Rusk   What we know as law is purely illusion. What cops and the judiciary do is the law, up to and including outright murder. Steve Rusk   Ignorance of the law is no excuse, unless of course you’re a cop. dennisbohner   I notice that it was the WOMEN who defended we commoners. Is it a reality that male asshats are in the legal profession to make decisions that fit the patriarchial ideals of suppression of others and control? WTF is wrong with the ideals that they gained? Nearly everything. Tabbytha   As long as a person is doing what is right, who cares what gender they are? So many men and women are NOT doing what is right, finding those who do is uncommon these days, lets not make this a gender issue and be glad some good people still exist. I wish more people would speak up, the world is pretty much going to hell in a handbasket and the US is in deep trouble right now. Robert Farrior   The police state marches on, here again under the impetus of the selective drug war, the number one fount of tyranny in this nation! They must all be removed from power! robertsrevolution.net   Remember, cops and judges ain’t bulletproof. MaryMacMaster   not these Nimrods sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court swear a sacred oath and make a covenant to honor, uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution???",0.0
