The room full of Second Amendment fanatics panicked when one of Trump’s fans yelled “gun!” and Trump was rushed from the stage. Immediately, Trump’s campaign began spinning the lie that this man had intended to assassinate Trump.   In fact, all he was armed with was a poster saying “Republicans Against Trump.” The whole incident was over nothing. But it didn’t stop Trump’s fans from pretending this proved Trump was a profile in courage. His campaign’s social media director retweeted a (false) message that Trump was back on stage after an “assassination attempt”– like he was Teddy goddamn Roosevelt, speaking with a bullet in his chest .

He returned to the stage precisely because there was no threat . Mere minutes after agents tackled the “assassin” they realized the guy was a harmless protester carrying a poster and had no weapons. He was released shortly afterwards.   Meanwhile, there is an example of a candidate staring down a scary situation and not blinking. It’s Hillary Clinton.   Unlike the poster-carrying Republican, a protester in Iowa once rushed Clinton’s stage and actually almost got within arm’s reach of her. She took a quick glance as her Secret Service detail tackled the protester… and kept talking. Protester tries to storm the stage as Clinton speaks in Iowa.

And she – again – just stared the person down.   So let’s hear Trump’s followers call Hillary Clinton brave for doing what Trump did not. We’ll wait.   Featured image via CNN",0.0
