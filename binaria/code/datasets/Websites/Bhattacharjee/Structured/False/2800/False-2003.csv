Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016   While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported.   Charlie Spiering wrote:   “He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,” Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween.   Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump.   “Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war,” she said.   She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously.   “But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,” she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender.   She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin.   “I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don’t think so,” she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day.   A post at Barracuda Brigade observed:   Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of “hope and change” when in fact it is just more of the same.   Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing.   Still, we have to ask — was Clinton’s “hint” a “warning” or a “threat?”   Related:",0.0
