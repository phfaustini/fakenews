He cleaned Hillary’s clock.   This is what Trump’s electoral map looks like.   This looks like a country UNITED.   Trump’s victory was a thrashing of the political and media elite – the American people rallied against global stooges like Mitt Romney and John Kasich, two morons who unsuccessfully attempted to STOP Trump every step of the way.   Kasich did not vote for Trump, opting instead to help Hillary by writing-in John McCain’s name.   Now, however, these twp clowns have changed their tune and tweeted out war congratulations to Donald Trump.   Screw them. Best wishes for our duly elected president: May his victory speech be his guide and preserving the Republic his aim.   — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 9, 2016 The American people have spoken and it’s time to come together. Congratulations President-elect @realDonaldTrump .   — John Kasich (@JohnKasich) November 9, 2016 Amy Moreno is a Published Author , Pug Lover & Game of Thrones Nerd.
