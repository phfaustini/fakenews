The interruption was a happy one, however, since the woman was down from Massachusetts, where she said Trump has a lot of support. Sadly, Sessions did not recover his train of thought regarding Coulter’s article, but immediately began to talk about immigration, which more than made up for the loss.   I think he must be the very best Senator. So noble and sincere. And the fact that he reads Ann Coulter adds to his charm.",0.0
