According to the agreement between the regime and Hillary Clinton while she was SOS all funds given to them from foreign donors had to be cleared by the State Department. Wikileaks exposed the “gift” a while back. And now they are forced to admit it. And figure out a way to “excuse” it. Reply - Share uncle Bob 1 Today 9:25 pm   To the US’s “eternal shame” we now have the choice for President between the “smut talking clown” (Trump) and the “criminal warmonger” (Clinton).I don’t really care too much about Trump’s antics. But I have kids,and friends,I don’t want dying in neo-con wars.So the choice is totally clear for me. I’m hoping Trump wins. Though I’m not holding my breath over that hope. Reply - Share",0.0
