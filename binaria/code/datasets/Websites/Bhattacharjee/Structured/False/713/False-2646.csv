The 2-minute video is apparently taken during the riots Saturday night following the shooting of a black, armed man who was reportedly a gang member.   Moments after the shooting occurred, hundreds of rioters took to the streets, setting cars on fire and burning about a half-dozen businesses. Chants of “Black Power!” could be heard sporadically as well. But in this video, it appears an entire gang of black youth are seeking out and targeting white people to assault.  “Hey! We’re beating up every white person! Get every white person!” the cameraman says.   When he witnesses someone being assaulted, he asks “Who they beatin’ up? Who they beaten’ up?”   At one point, when they spot a “white person,” he screams “He white! Beat his shit! Beat!”   The thug pans around looking for white people to assault. You can hear the crowd reacting, trying to point out white people. Again, he cries: “Hey! They beating up every white person!” Apparently he spots a homeless man. “Look at the f***in’ white bum! Look at the white bum!”  Throughout the rest of the video, there’s screams of white people as their racist hunt continues.   Toward the end, shots ring out in the distance, startling the cameraman. “Who the f*** is shooting? Stop shooting!” Moments later, shots are fired much closer and the video ends.”   This is the direct result of the Black Lives Matter racist, anti-police agenda and Barack Obama’s acceptance of their cause.   This is Obama’s “ post-racial America .” Welcome to it, folks .",0.0
