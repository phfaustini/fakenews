I notice here at GLP the amount of doom sayers seems to go down when a republican is in office (Bush). But when the left get in office the doomsaying increases. Now i am sure the effect is opposite. If trump gets in office i am sure the doomsaying will increase on the left side of the political spectrum. Page 1,0.0
