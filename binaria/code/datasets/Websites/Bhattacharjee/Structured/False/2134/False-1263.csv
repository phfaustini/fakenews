They pretend that the anti-Trump protests are real spontaneous events although the prostitutes know that the “protests” are orchestrated by George Soros and front groups for the Oligarchy such as change.org and other fake progressive groups funded by the oligarchs.  Soros, change.org and various progressive and leftwing fronts for the oligarchs pretend to be for democracy, but they are acting in behalf of Oligarchy. We are witnessing a direct attack on American democracy. These protesters are the hired mercenary enemy of the American people.  Below is an email I received from a friend in Massachusetts. They preach peace and love while they commit violence:   Below is one of the emails I rec’d regarding immediate organizing to get rid of Trump. JWJ is Jobs for Justice serving Massachusetts with the main group in Boston and the subsidiary in western MA. You appear to be correct, because I rec’d the notice below the day following the election and election results were not even in until 3:00 a.m. Moveon.org was/is behind this one. Moveon.org is link under 3rd local event.  Dear JWJ and allies,  If you were like me, today was a hard day to get up. Donald Trump is  the president-elect, and last night Republicans took the House, the  Senate, and thus the Supreme Court. This is a terrible situation for  humanity, let alone the workers’ movement and our ability to expand  organizing and collective bargaining rights. And yet, there is no time  to really brood about it. We are called to take immediate action.  Today, we are joining with others throughout the movement to demonstrate  our non-consent with the election results, in particular the election of  Donald Trump. This evening, thousands will gather in cities across the  nation to affirm to ourselves and one another that we will not give up  the fight-the fight for a nation with liberty and justice for all. We  will stand with one another, across race, religion, gender, age,  ability, national origin, sexual orientation, and all of our identities.  We will join hands, pledge our solidarity, and resolve to forge ahead  even in this moment of peril and challenge. See local events below.   Check out moveon.org/standtogether.  In these most difficult of political moments, we have to come together  and stand stronger. Never has the “I ‘ll  Be There” pledge been more necessary than today.
