A technician works to prepare voting machines to be used in the upcoming presidential election, in Philadelphia, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016.   Could these connections be enough to implicate the Clinton Foundation in the alleged early vote rigging in Texas?   As usual, the internet has come through as the ultimate watchdog while the supposed safeguards of our democracy have failed.   A Gab user by the name “Special Prosecutor Will Logan” has found some stunning information. Note: as Gab is a members only site, you’ll have to join to see his actual posts, but we included all pertinent information in the article. Click to enlarge   According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group.   The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches?   Either way, it doesn’t look good.   But there’s more.   As the same user notes in this post , Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project.   According to the project’s own website : In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections. As a large number of election staff are women, there will be an emphasis on training women, who will be the first to benefit from the skills transfer training and use of AVMs. It is estimated that 100 women will directly benefit from election technology skills training per pilot election.   Of course, this is all speculation, and we are not making any claims of illegal activity by the Clinton Foundation.   However, it presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations.   Consider the implications further abroad, as well. Could this DELIAN Project be designed to influence elections in developing nations?   It can certainly be argued that electronic voting machines do not in fact provide an “improved electoral process” or provide “safer elections”   Again, this is speculation.
