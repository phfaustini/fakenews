Paul Ryan in Wisconsin; Aspiring congressman Paul Nehlen is apparently in the throes of full-on masochism. This just in: Paul Nehlen, defeated by Ryan in primary, to challenge @SpeakerRyan for House speaker. Ok then… pic.twitter.com/0Hq3vB2GIV   — Eliana Johnson (@elianayjohnson) October 26, 2016 Wow. Paul Nehlen announced he's challenging Paul Ryan for House Speaker pic.twitter.com/GDJ5cOW3qL   — Allan Smith (@akarl_smith) October 26, 2016   Speaker Ryan must be terrified right now. NOT A PARODY: Guy who Lost to Paul Ryan By 70 Points Announces Bid For Speaker https://t.co/tlDyib2Uio via @RightWisconsin   — Real Charlie Sykes (@SykesCharlie) October 26, 2016 @elianayjohnson @Olivianuzzi @SpeakerRyan Well he only lost to Paul Ryan by 70% ""It was rigged""   — Stacy R (@In2why) October 26, 2016   Wow. With such a proven track record, it’s no wonder Nehlen’s brimming with confidence.
