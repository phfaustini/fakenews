According to Guccifer 2.0 the software used by FEC networks may be vulnerable to fraud.   — GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) November 4, 2016   From Guccifer 2.0: I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.   As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.   I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.
