Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help.   My “deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs,” Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks   “Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion.

Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind.”   Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare “blighted communities” disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure.   He also said he’d support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities.
