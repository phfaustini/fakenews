Heyes (NaturalNews) The 'global warming/climate change' charade is bad enough in that it is nothing more than a politically motivated ""issue"" used by globalists of all political stripes to gain more control over the world's population.But now it's costing some citizens scarce tax dollars.As reported by The Daily Caller , a top university in Britain has been caught stealing millions of taxpayer dollars from a federal budget that is chronically in the red just to produce phony global warming data .A global warming research center at the London School of Economics received millions of dollars (pounds) from UK taxpayers after taking credit for research it did not perform.The UK's Daily Mail noted further that the UK government provided £9 million ($11 million in US dollars) in funding to the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) in exchange for research that was never done. Massive scientific fraud regarding 'global warming' A number of papers that CCCEP claimed to have published to receive government funding were not even about global warming and were written before the organization was even founded, or written by researchers who were not affiliated with the center. Worse, government officials never bothered to check CCCEP's alleged publication lists, saying instead they were ""taken on trust,"" according to a recently released report.""It is serious misconduct to claim credit for a paper you haven't supported, and it's fraud to use that in a bid to renew a grant,"" Professor Richard Tol, a climate economics expert from Sussex University whose research was reportedly stolen by CCCEP, told the Daily Mail . ""I've never come across anything like it before. It stinks.""The center's chairman since 2008 has been Nick Stern, a well-known global advocate for more policy action supposedly aimed at combating climate change. In addition he is also the president of the British Academy, an invitation-only society that is reserved for the academic elite and which disburses grant money in the millions of pounds to researchers, as well as Lord Stern's own organization.In recent days the CCCEP, which is jointly based at the London School of Economics and the University of Leeds, hosted a gala event that was attended by experts and officials from around the world. The occasion: A celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the Stern Review, a 700-page report detailing the alleged economic impact of climate change, a review that was commissioned by Tony Blair's government.The massive paper claimed that the world must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face dramatically higher costs in the future. The review exerted a great amount of power and influence on a series of British governments, as well as international organizations.But now the report's contents and conclusions are in serious doubt. Not the first time global warming data has been FAKED Following the Daily Mail 's report, CCCEP spokesman Bob Ward admitted the organization had ""made mistakes,"" in both claiming credit for studies it did not perform and foro papers that were actually researched and published by other academics.Academics and experts whose work was falsely represented were furious, including one who said CCCEP's actions were ""a clear case of fraud – using deception for financial gain,"" The DC reported.Studies receiving financial support from the public sector are not required to disclose it as an ethical conflict of interest, even when financial support is in the millions of dollars. The DC noted that recent studies in the United States, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to support the 'scientific' case for its massive new power plant regulations, the Clean Power Plan, saw the agency give $32.1 million, $9.5 million, and $3.65 million in public funds to lead authors – all of whom essentially provided the agency with the 'results' it wanted.As Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in June 2014 , this isn't the first time so-called global warming/climate change data has been faked.
