If the media said, ""Trump's a genius, women like him, he's a man's man, he's dynamic, he's vibrant... but Hillary is crooked and she's a criminal and no one likes her"" Blah Blah... if that happened, women would support and vote for Trump, etc.Think about that. Just flip the whole thing.There's never been a pile-on in MSM history like the one against Trump.While he had a few unforced errors, I don't think it would matter much what he did. They would trash him, or drag up 10 year old Tweets and play them 24/7 all day, even if he had pivoted to being presidential.If they wanted to prop up Trump and destroy Hillary, we would have seen the opposite happen.This entire election has been nothing more than an exercise in mass propaganda. Hillary is the chosen candidate of the Establishment, and she shall win. Early voting totals already show the Democrats are showing up in big numbers for Hillary, and Republicans are lagging behind.The election IS rigged, but largely by the media and voting scams may not be necessary if the Sheeple are compliant .
