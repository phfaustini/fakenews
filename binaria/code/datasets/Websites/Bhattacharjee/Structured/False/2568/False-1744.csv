The whistleblowing organization has now published more than 55,600 emails in a series of daily online releases which it said were building towards the November 8 presidential election.  Emails released Sunday included messages accusing Chelsea Clinton of using Clinton Foundation funds for her wedding as well as leaked transcripts of Bill Clintonâ€™s fundraising speeches.  WikiLeaks has claimed its email publishing servers suffered a sustained DoS attack after it released #DNCLeak2 over the weekend.  THERE ARE 2 ADDITIONAL LEAKS ADDED TO THIS STORY COMPARED TO THE STANDARD RT STORY. THEY ARE AT THE BOTTOM.  Goldman Sachs speeches   In an email from January 23, 2016 Clinton Research Director Tony Carrk quoted the Democratic presidential nominee apparently expressing little appetite for prosecuting rogue Wall Street bankers.  In the mail to Clinton campaign Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri, Press Secretary Brian Fallon and Podesta, Carrk said he was sending excerpts from Clintonâ€™s Goldman Sachs speeches.  â€œI’m not interested in, you know, turning the clock back or pointing fingers,â€ Clinton is reported to have told Tim Oâ€™Neill, formerly of SJU Wall Street Trading Room and Credit Suisse, following a paid speech.  Clinton apparently then went on to recommend that the financial sector take a leading role in setting out regulations for their own troubled industry: â€œThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad.â€  Less than one year earlier, Democratic media adviser Mandy Grunwald suggested to Podesta in another communication leaked Monday that Clinton should take a conciliatory tone with regard to Wall Street.  â€œI would include something from the Maggie Haberman piece on HRC’s Goldman Sachs speech,â€ writes Grunwald.  â€œSomething like, “When HRC recently spoke to bankers at Goldman Sachs, instead of holding them accountable for their activities that crashed the economy, she told them that banker bashing was foolish and had to stop. She said “soothing” that we all got into our economic problems together.”  â€˜Illegal ivoryâ€™ as leverage on China   Hillary Clinton directed her now-campaign chair Podesta to use reports of illegal elephant tusk smuggling by Chinese government officials as â€œleverageâ€ during a 2014 White House visit to the nation.  Three days before President Obamaâ€™s visit to Beijing in November 2014, the former secretary of state highlighted a NY Times article on how Chinese delegates reportedly smuggled home poached ivory from Tanzania.  A message from Clintonâ€™s hrod17@clintonemail.com opens by praising Podestaâ€™s â€œteasingâ€ of reporters and â€œflashesâ€ of a smile at a recent press conference before asking the then-White House adviser to raise the ivory story with Chinaâ€™s president directly.  â€œOn China, I know youâ€™ll be in Beijing next week, so am sending a news report about how Xiâ€™s official party on its visit to Tanzania loaded up their planes w poached ivory, likely w full knowledge of [President Jakaya] Kikweteâ€™s government,â€ Clinton writes.  â€œPlease raise this issue directly w XI, both because it is critical on the merits but also because it’s another way you can gain some leverage with the Chinese.â€  The email subject line was, â€œBelow is what I sent POTUS on election and China poaching.â€  A â€˜fact sheetâ€™ provided by the White House regarding Obamaâ€™s visit shows discussions centered on the ebola crisis, economic relations, and a â€œshared vision for Afghanistan.â€ An effort to work together to â€œstop the trade in illegal wildlife productsâ€ is also mentioned.  Clinton â€˜totally blewâ€™ crime question   New York Mayor Bill de Blasio thought Clinton â€œtotally blewâ€ a debate question about her support for a controversial federal crime bill passed by her husband.  In a March 2016 email , de Blasio was less than impressed with Clintonâ€™s attempt to pass off a question on mass incarceration to her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders back in March.  â€œHillary was fantastic on the gun control answer, then totally blew the mass incarceration question,â€ de Blasio wrote to Podesta.  The question was posed during a live CNN debate by anchor Don Lemon, who asked Clinton why black people should trust her to end a pattern of mass incarceration when she supported a 1994 law which many blame for â€œlocking up a generation of black men.â€  Clinton began her answer by reminding people that Sanders also supported the bill, a tactic which appears to have irked Mayor de Blasio.  â€œWhy on Earth did she say â€˜Are you going to ask Senator Sanders that question?â€™ instead of just addressing the issue,â€ de Blasio wrote.  â€œWhen she makes it about her, she loses the high ground. Stating the obvious, I know, but she keeps doing itâ€Śâ€  Podesta brothers plan to influence India on NGO clampdown   Podesta sought to enlist the help of his lobbyist brother to influence an Indian Intelligence Bureau crackdown on Greenpeace and a key donor, the Ford Foundation, Mondayâ€™s leaked emails reveal.  Correspondence between John and Tony Podesta from May 2015 show the pair planned a lunch with the Indian ambassador to discuss a â€œvery serious situationâ€ facing Greenpeace in which the Indian government accused the group of financial irregularities. The claims eventually led to the cancellation of its license to operate there.  The bid to influence Indiaâ€™s decision-making came at the request of Karen Sack, managing director of conservation group Ocean Unite, who asked if John Podesta could get in touch with his brother at The Podesta Group.  â€œApparently The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in the US, but Kumi [Naidoo, Greenpeace executive director] has no way to reach Tony or another principal,â€ Sack writes.  John Podesta forwarded the â€œsmall requestâ€ to his brother, highlighting Kumi Naidooâ€™s large following globally.  â€œWant to talk to the head of Greenpeace? Kumi Naidoo is a very well known South African with a big international following, but I think the GOI [Government of India] likely to stick it to them.â€  He also explained he was trying to use his influence to help the Ford Foundation charity, which had similarly â€œgot on the wrong side of GOIâ€. However, he expressed a belief that their issue â€œcan be more easily resolved.â€  A reply from Tony Podesta proposes a lunch with an Indian ambassador as well as confirmation he would be â€œhappyâ€ to talk to Greenpeace.  A leaked July 2015 email about funding shows Podesta describing global charity the Ford Foundation as a â€œ mainstay â€ for the Center for American Progress think-tank, which he founded in 2003.  Clintonâ€™s emails could â€˜either win 49 states, or lose 49 statesâ€™   As previously reported , in March of 2015, Clintonâ€™s camp were debating whether Hillary should make a joke about her â€œemail situationâ€.  Staffers were â€œnervousâ€ about the â€œpotentially nutsâ€ move and, in freshly leaked correspondence, sought advice from Philippe Reines â€“ a former senior adviser from Clintonâ€™s days as Secretary of State and someone who was likely privy to the contents of said emails.  â€œTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth,â€ said Reines.  â€œBut I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi,â€ he warned.  â€œWe canâ€™t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan [Schwerin, Clintonâ€™s speech writer] can think of a light way to say â€œI am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read whatâ€™s in them as a way to better understand that workâ€Śâ€ Reines suggested.  Bernie Sanders is a Jerk   We have previously reported about the agreement between Bernie Sanders and Clinton Campaign. We have also previously reported about Hillary’s others insults about Bernie’s supporters: basement-dwellers, bucket of losers, stupid millennials, etc. but now here’s another one.  This email is part of the DNC Leaks not of Podesta. DNC insider Hilary Rosen was caught emailing Jon Reinish and telling him that “Bernie Sanders is a petty jerk”: yes, she has a statement coming out. he is a petty jerk  Trump is right, Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo   Another DNC Leak email says that Donald Trump is right about Megyn Kelly. Yes she is a BIMBO! Well well well but you freaks of nature were saying Trump is a sexist for saying that. Then that means you too are sexists you Democrat liars.  Source   ",0.0
