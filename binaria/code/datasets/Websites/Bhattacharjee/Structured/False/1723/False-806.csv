Sadly, Comey is likely to go down in history as the man that struck the final death blow to the rule of law in America. During his address to the media, Comey admitted that Clinton sent or received 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified material at the time they were sent. But of course there were probably many more. Comey told the press that it was “ likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce … that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices .” So basically Clinton turned over to the FBI whatever she felt like turning over, and then she destroyed the rest of the evidence. As a former lawyer, this infuriates me, but it doesn’t surprise me.   In fact, it doesn’t surprise me at all that Hillary Clinton was allowed to skate. I expected this all along. If you search the thousands of articles that I have posted on The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream , you will find many articles where I say that Hillary Clinton should be in prison, but not a single one where I ever said that I thought she would be going to prison.   This is how politics in America works today. People like Bill and Hillary Clinton could openly sacrifice children to Satan on the White House lawn and still probably not get into trouble. Despite scandal after scandal going all the way back to Arkansas in the 1980s, nothing ever sticks to them, and nothing probably ever will.   In this case, FBI director James Comey essentially had to rewrite federal law in order to clear Clinton. This is something that Andrew McCarthy explained very well in his article entitled “FBI Rewrites Federal Law to Let Hillary Off the Hook” …   There is no way of getting around this: According to Director James Comey (disclosure: a former colleague and longtime friend of mine), Hillary Clinton checked every box required for a felony violation of Section 793(f) of the federal penal code (Title 18): With lawful access to highly classified information she acted with gross negligence in removing and causing it to be removed it from its proper place of custody, and she transmitted it and caused it to be transmitted to others not authorized to have it, in patent violation of her trust. Director Comey even conceded that former Secretary Clinton was “extremely careless” and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications (her own and those she corresponded with) being intercepted by foreign intelligence services. —–   In essence, in order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require. The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing. The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant. People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence.   The amazing thing is that the FBI handled a highly similar case very, very differently less than a year ago. Just check out what happened to Naval reservist Bryan Nishimura …   U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials. Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance.   According to court documents, Nishimura was a Naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. In his role as a Regional Engineer for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers. Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system .   Nishimura’s actions came to light in early 2012, when he admitted to Naval personnel that he had handled classified materials inappropriately . Nishimura later admitted that, following his statement to Naval personnel, he destroyed a large quantity of classified materials he had maintained in his home . Despite that, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Nishimura’s home in May 2012, agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms. The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel.   So what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton?   Neither of them ever intended to do anything wrong.   So why were they treated so differently?   Needless to say, social media is exploding with outrage over this decision to let Clinton go free. Many Americans are openly asking why they should continue to play by the rules if politicians like Hillary Clinton are not required to do so.   Unfortunately, this is what America has become. Our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a society, and as I have stated before Hillary Clinton is going to be the overwhelming favorite if there is an election in November. At this moment, she has solid leads in all of the “swing states”, and she only really needs to win one of them …   Perhaps you enjoy talk of battleground states. Well, there’s a scenario for you, too. First, pick the six “closest” swing states (VA, NH, IA, OH, FL, NC). Got it? Now understand that New Hampshire excepted, Clinton only has to win one of them in order to reach the requisite 270 electoral votes to win . (Optional third step for Republicans only: start shotgunning Pabst Blue Ribbon and don’t stop until November.)   Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states. According to a Ballotpedia battleground poll released last week, Trump trails by 14% in Florida, 4% in Iowa, 10% in North Carolina, 9% in Ohio, and 7% in Virginia.   Hillary Clinton is a horrible, evil, miserable human being , and right now she is the odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.   But ultimately it is the American people that are to blame for blindly supporting corrupt politicians such as Clinton, and if they willingly pick her to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow. The Price Of Silver Explodes Past 20 Dollars An Ounce As The European Banking Crisis Deepens » Daddyotis   I struggle trying to get my head around this. It goes against all reasonable consideration of law and civilized society. What refocuses and grounds me is when I consider that this is another puzzle piece of end time prophecy being put into place. This brings me closer to an understanding of Gods will for me and my place in it all. The best part is that I am already saved and cleared for the afterlife.   God Bless all   DO Michael Dubin   Presidents Clinton, Bush II, and Obama have gotten away with murder, so why would anyone think that Hillary would be charged over some illegal server? K   Well the final proof. We have the best Government and law enforcement money can buy. Amf boy have they been bought. A Republic requires an informed electorate.to survive. And we sure do not have that. So welcome to the new America, all the justice you can afford/ Steeve Girard   dude… accidental web address electorate (dot) to Michèle   We turned on the TV just to watch the announcement that Comey had to make about Clinton. Just as he made the announcement that indicated that their recommendations to the DOJ would be to not press charges, that very second a loud boom went off in my house sounding exactly like a cannon and my husband and both sons saw a purple bolt of lightning outside and a ball of fire and then my TV froze with the words coming out Aof Comey’s mouth. I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. We all felt that it had spiritual implications in regards to the announcement made. aldownunder   What did you do then? Pack another cone Jerry C   Lightning is called the Finger of God. Believers are getting signs all over the place. Shalom. R.bitting   She said she was sorry, geesh man, don’t overreact. Its not like our nation’s survival is on the line. In all seriousness though, If folks can’t see the writing on the wall here ( and you know they won’t ), theres no hope left. TheCogitator   American has not become a lawless nation, it has been a lawless nation for quite sometime. Now they don’t even try to cover it up.“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Hillary is an example of a “more equal” one — way more equal. SnohtBlossom   Liberals are the SCUM of the earth!!! rushmore   amen to that Gogen!!, gogenhouser   the liberal mind is a demonic mind, heathen reprobate bloodsuckers and that goes double for the demoncrat voter!!! joe   you are apiece of sh-t SnohtBlossom   you are a piece of crahp Guest   I was thinking te same thing. The elites don’t bother covering up their deeds or their intentions anymore. That in itself says a lot…. Steeve Girard   After I learned this BS here’s the . All the lies can you say, to the dumb public minds… What so proud as we’re hailed, as the twilight last gleaming… Who broad stripes and bright stars, lost in meaningless fights… O’er the ramparts torn down, by some “gallantly” Streaming… (tv) And the debt red glare, and the money made of air… Gave proof to the night that the flag is now gone… Where does that star spangled banner yet wave…. O’er the land of the owned, and the home of the slaves…. Creepy Pedro   O’er the land of the Freeloaders, and the Home of the Debt Slaves Steeve Girard   Amen. This is an insanity world nation in which we are living. Bill   You are so right Michael, tonight it is very hard to be a proud American. guest   Edward Snowden, as an American citizen I ,on behalf of all Americans apologize for this governments incredible hypocrisy . Redlucy   I am sick to my stomach about this. Even though I fully expected this decision, I had some tiny hope in my heart and soul that justice might be served. I am terrified of a US run by her….I can’t even say her name. She is a lying, scheming, demonic woman who needs all the prayers she can get, It is hard to fathom the implications that her communist agenda will bring about, We are in for some very great suffering,   Its just getting started my friend. She is the next president of America. Steeve Girard   Not if you guys can vote for a “third party” candidate. Joe Trevors   Every vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for Hillary. Jerry C   There is no “third party”; maybe a “two party” outside the Democrat/Republican sham coin. Joe Trevors   Yes, Jerry, that is true. That is what God has revealed through Donald Trump. It is clear to all of us how much hatred, contempt, almost demonic anger is expressed against Trump by both parties. They speak with one voice their true nature, don’t they? SnohtBlossom   I’ve said that Hillary would be cleared of this many times on this board. Hillary 2016! 😀 Suck it Lucy.. Rhino Horns   You should be ashamed of yourself. Unless you repent of your carnality and sins in this life, Judgment Day is going to be very difficult, and necessary, for you. JC Teecher   SB, you are hardcore. Sadly, you got a million more partners in crime, as liberal, atheistic, billery supporters. I would not want to be in any of your shoes when the 2nd advent is happening.   But, until then, go in Peace. none   Ex_Russian special forces do her “dirty ” ? Work? I think back to the days of breaking bad, the T.V. show. Mike, the “fixer” along with the rest of them, where to loyal to this country to ever do the kinds of things Hillary has been accused of doing. Even the U.S. Mafia. They helped out in the second world War. Mondobeyondo   Not if Bernie Sanders has anything to say about it. Which he doesn’t. bc   I look forward to HIllary being President 😀 I’ve told the board numerous times she would be cleared. Infidel51   Ya you’re the only one who saw that one coming dude. You’re a straight up genius. Bob332   AND very, very soon; satan has ruled the pass 7.5 yrs. The country cannot survive another 4. SnohtBlossom   there is no Satan JB   That’s exactly what he wants you to believe – that he’s not a threat, he’s not there, etc. Why do you think there are caricatures of him in a cape and horns, mocking the idea of him? You’re playing right into his hands… Steeve Girard   The is one, it’s between Abraham’s legs. Mike   I blog, therefore I am. Mike   You are one of the many proofs that Satan exists. SnohtBlossom   See? there IS a SnohtBlossom Mike   My point exactly. mdice11   You are a fool and hopefully a soon-to-be fatal victim of your own arrogance and filth. VoteTedCruz2016   Your dissenting opinion hurts my feelings. Please stop. Infidel51   Stop harshing my safe space bro. Your micro aggressions are not cool. DixieAngel_76   That’s what he wants people to think. ISA41:10   The Parasite Class doesn’t care what criminal acts Hillary has done. Neither do the illegals, convicted felons, or the dead………her natural constituency. jaxon64   Does it seem to anyone else INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT that the shooting ( and soon to come rioting) in Baton Rouge comes at a perfect time to drive the Hillary criminality out of the news? SnohtBlossom   All you poor boys are going to have to accept that Hillary was legally cleared and that she will be our new Glorious President. bobbi   After Hillary there will be no more America. VegasBob   Correction: She will be worse than Hitler, Lenin or Stalin. Richard O. Mann   Maybe one of her government paid bodyguards will step up and take care of matters, as a patriot. Infidel51   At least once she is elected we can get this show on the road and stop futzing around on the Internet. Obama was just the set up man, Hilary will blow this f$&@er sky high. DixieAngel_76   You will not be nearly so glib when you see the wreckage she leaves in her wake. jaxon64   I think I understand on a much deeper and clearer level now what the Apostle Paul meant when he called the future global leader, “the man of lawlessness.” It is more than just corruption and criminal closed-door activities, it is a complete disregard and “above any law” status. bobbi   It was not that way 1974 when Nixon was hounded out of office was much less that hillary has done. Infidel51   So the Tower of Sauron rises. Who is willing to stand against it? Q   “Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states.”   The lamestream medias are prepparing us for a massive Democrat voter fraud campaign in those states. Bevy   You are right Redlucy!!! We are going to go thru judgment because of our rampant sin and only a small remnant will survive!!! im4truth4all   James Comey has joined James Clapper, John Koskinen, John Kerry, etc. I have lived almost 74 years and have never seen as corrupt an administration as this one. My estimate of years left based on my genetic profile is probably 5 to 10 years. I feel sorry for my descendants. I personally feel this country is in the last years of its existence. Kent Harris   9/11 was God’s judgment against this nation. Please read the Isaiah 9:10 prophesy and then read what God will do to this nation as a result of our defiance from Isaiah 9:11-10:4. He will utterly destroy this nation. You say that God will never do such a thing. He will and know this that when you walk into church, any church and see if any pulpits says anything at all about this this coming Sunday. The answer will be no. God in the prophecy says the pulpit is wholly to blame. During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None. Why? Because God has blinded just like pharaoh of Egypt the pulpit. They have been consumed with the outward versus the inward. They are vipers among vipers. Steeve Girard   911 was the warning of the Arab World… the Americans ignored it with “exceptionalism”. Time to cough-up. bahmi   911 was meant to blame Muslims for everything connected, but the jews and neocons were behind 911, along with the Saudis. This was, however, a distraction so the real bad guys could install people like Obongo and let his destructive agenda destroy us, choke us in debt, focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging, etc. While we were occupied with the distractions, the real bad guys did their thing and now have us on the precipice of total destruction and NWO marginalization. If you voted for Obama, YOU are part of the problem. GV   “…focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging….”   ever obsessed with Teh Gays Paul Patriot   Amen. This Is why I am convinced Hitlery will be the next president. It’s all apart of the plan to destroy American Constitution and sovereignty during her “reign”   She is what the sheeple, illegals and liberal, progressives are calling for, and the Lord will oblige the desires of those who mock, blaspheme and spit in the face of the God of our heritage, “nature’s God”   Nothing will change until the pulpits start preaching Truth and a nation repents JC Teecher   All is going along with the prophetic word and the nations are aiding and abetting to the “fullness of the Gentiles”, (islamic peoples). JC Teecher   The pulpits, for the most part, are bringing about the apostasy. sad   No, the church wants to be liked and civil in this matter. Sin is a three letter bad word. Churches are more interested in”community” and not scaring people off with the truth. Unfortunately, that is the majority of churches today.They didn’t scare me. The only truth that scared me was Hell and I was scared into the kingdom by God’s love for me a sinner. That He died for me to save me. Don’t hear much about that these days. Politically incorrect. on the way to Hell. Jerry C   Actually, I’d say sin is a five-letter word, death. lol watchmannonthewall   I somewaht agree with you regarding God’s move against the US, but I tend more towards 9/11 being one of a couple of disciplines and warnings, the 2008 meltdown was the other, regarding coming judgment on the nation rather than it actually being a judgment. If Athaliah becomes president, she will be just like the real Athaliah; narcissistic and paranoid, and her rage will extend to “Christians”. She is power hungary and has a self destruct button that will take all with her. At that point, I think it quite likely the warnings of the destruction of America by about 2020-21 will probably occur. Joe Trevors   I believe we are experiencing the End Times battle between the Body of Christ & the Body of Antichrist. Our war is not against flesh & blood but against the spiritual powers on high. Yes, Kent, you do see how our nation is being transformed by the installation of leaders in our society who are following the Antichrist. But also our nation is filled with millions of people who are following the Christ. One way I see this is to view Islam as the Trojan Horse to bring down Christianity. Yes, it is bringing down the Church but it cannot hurt the Head of the Church, Jesus, so it is making war on the Body of Christ, the members one of another. You can today how Islam is being used by our government to destroy the Church in Syria? Muslims are killing Christians & other Muslims in Syria. NowAlive   Perhaps Mr Cahn is right. It’s an interesting premise, to be sure. What I will say is that the idea that “none”, meaning no pulpits spoke out against homosexual marriage, is simply wrong. Many spoke of judgment because of it. But you are certainly right about vipers filling the most pulpits. They are indeed blind. Alas that the Baby Boomers now run this country…off a cliff. GV   “…During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None….”   Pharisee, fixated on genitalia while remaining SILENT on American war crimes around the world   She is the next president of America. Joe Trevors   Only God knows who will be the next President. It is important for us to pray to the Lord & trust God as we say the Lord’s prayer in part, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven”. We need our faith more than ever during these days of tribulations. God can do anything he wants. God answers our prayers but we do not understand how he answers us, do we? Oz Steamer   She looks likely to be the LAST President of the United States. Jerry C   Why would TPTB collapse the economy on one of their own? My gut says they want a white conservative Christian male at the helm to blame it on, so Trump is the man of the hour. Next feast on God’s timetable is Feast of Trumpets (the last Trump believers are watching for); coincidence? I think not. Brian   I will not be voting because the next President, Hillary has already been “selected.” Hillary with a satanic grin on her disgusting face will be taking our guns, and sending us to FEMA camps. I have No doubt that these are the End Times! God bless eveyone. Steeve Girard   Vote for a “third party” candidate. If you do not vote, your voice will be dissolved in the remainders who will vote. check your list of candidates. Joe Trevors   Why don’t you vote for Donald who is not corrupt like the career politicians? alan   Looks like she been selected to be the next president. Now just figure out how to get rid of Trump. I suspect as a last resort the election will be thrown to her in November. Its just like we are living in an African country. Steeve Girard   The USA is a third world country since 2007. Creepy Pedro   Since 1913. guest   I heard all sorts of platitudes about what an upright, honest, law and order guy Comey is. There was going to be a revolt in the FBI, remember? He’s just another flunky political appointee who caved in like a house of cards. Judges have never accepted Ignorance of the law as a valid defense if your a plumber or a pizza cook but if your a lawyer and Secretary of State it’s acceptable. My mailman could have told me that server and private email account were illegal and erasing those 30,000 or so emails was destroying evidence and obstructing justice. The Clintons, Lynch and Comey have utterly disgraced the system and themselves. SnohtBlossom   HIllary 2016! guest   And Lynch for Attorney General and Comey for FBI Director!! Now lets see…Who can we get for Ambassador to Libya? Bill G Wilminton NC   If it Is God’s Will Trump Will Be The Next President….Pray For Our Country….And the Safety Of Trump.   God’s Ways are Higher Than Our Ways and Gods Thoughts Are Higher Than Our Thoughts.   Shalom Randy   Oh, it’s because this god is on duty 24/7/365 that the Pope rides around in a box made of bullet proof glass?!?! If there was any man or woman who you would think of as having some kind of Divine protection, it would be this god’s right hand man, right?? Mark   The pope is the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Jesus Christ is the head of the true Church. They have little more in common than the word Church. Steeve Girard   And Jesus, God, Allah are “wieners”, relics of the first cult of humanity which worshipped sex. Mark   Steeve, God has written a psalm just for you and all who believe as you do. Read Psalm 2 in the KJV, the true Words of God. One day God will laugh at you and deride you. Exercise your free will wisely. Bill G Wilminton NC   At the Right Hand of God Sits Yeshua (Jesus)….   The Pope is the head of a Religious Organization called The Roman Catholic Church. Chris   pope is not God’s right hand man. Jesus is His right hand man. Duh. Randy   Yeah, well it’s not much of a god who would let His “only begotten Son” be tortured to death then. No thanks, I’ll take a pass on that one there. And a REAL God would have infinite love and compassion for His inferior Creations along with complete understanding, so to laugh at and deride us would not be in keeping with the attributes of a REAL god. Just a fake one. But that kind of logical reasoning makes the head of a Jesus freak explode if they think too long on it. Guest   To vote for the lesser of 2 evils is still a vote for EVIL…… SnohtBlossom   there is no god AriusArmenian   Check out what Comey did to Martin Armstrong. More of the same. The bi-partisan oligarchic elites that rule the US use the law to keep us in line while they laugh all the way to the bank. none   A postal worker could lose his job, for saying something like that. gogenhouser   This makes me want to throw up, this is no longer America. Demoncrats a bunch of baby murdering bloodsuckers. Steeve Girard   lol! df NJ   Poverty kills much more people than abortion. I wish Republicans had a brain equally matching their conscious.

Bill G Wilminton NC   While in Poverty you do not have your Arms and Legs Ripped OFF…..One At A Time. Bob332   Idiot’s such as yourself, are COMPLETELY soulless. Joe Trevors   Remember: is this not the same FBI that stopped investigating Omar the Orlando Shooter? The FBI had no time to follow Omar? They did not want to infringe on Omar’s constitutional rights because Obama forbids us to discriminate against Muslims. Omar got a job at a security company so he could protect us. Omar’s Dad was preaching what Omar followed. Omar’s Dad works for the CIA. The FBI was forbidden to bother Omar no matter what he threatened. The FBI does not even know to investigate Omar’s dad. What about the MOSQUE where Omar worshipped? The FBI is super good – in covering up!! Randy   GREAT post there, Joe! Except that Orlando was a completely contrived event, just like Sandy Hoax. WHERE were the ambulances to carry off the dead bodies? Where was all of the blood? Did everybody who was shot at either place just happen to leave all their blood at home that day? The temps in Connecticut on DECEMBER 14, 2012 were 30.6 for the low and 49.3 for the high, yet not one wisp of breath fog from ANYBODY there!! How is that possible? Check The Old Farmer’s Almanac for the weather reports on the 14th and 15th. Joe Trevors   Yes, how can they cover up so much with so little outrage from them in Orlando? Randy   Quite easily! Since the media is in bed with the corrupted legal system and political system, they just ignore the outrage, they don’t report on it, therefore very few ever hear about it! Someone forgot to check the records to see what the weather would possibly be like on December 14, 2012, and that’s how that very important clue got left out of the narrative when the hoax was launched! You don’t see anyone being asked on Tee Vee why there was no snow on the ground or breath fog from the people because the media doesn’t want to have questions like that being asked! SnohtBlossom   You have NO CHOICE! Enjoy it.. Bwah hah haha   Snotty….When ya have to give YOURSELF an UPVOTE…… its time to retire your flower ! SnohtBlossom   It helps keep the discussion orderly. Ok, so I LIKE the Limelight. Working fulltime here 😉 guest   Does anyone remember what president demanded the resignation of every U.S .Attorney in the country and made them all reapply for their jobs so he could hire whomever he wanted and get rid of the ones he didn’t like? I’ll give you all one guess. Steeve Girard   G.W. Bush! aka Bush II. . Guess only a Canadian could answer this one. guest   WRONG!!!! Bush fired 8U.S. Attorneys and caused a firestorm in the establishment media. Clinton fired ALL 93 U. S. Attorneys. Steeve Girard   At least I knew Bush did some… forgot about Clinton. Damn selectiveness of memory! guest   Oh…your Canadian? I forgot to mention we were betting a six pack of Molson. guest   The FBI probably thought blondie deserved a break because she was a “woman of color” like Elizabeth Warren max gon   You are absolutely right Michael, if the USA spineless population picks this evil woman to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow. Joe Trevors   Our greatest hope is to vote for Donald Trump. I believe God is using Donald. It is a sign by the overwhelming opposition against him by both Democrats & Republicans. Look at Republican Paul Ryan as House Majority leader: he has no trouble “understanding” Obama or Clinton. But he can’t “understand” Trump? Paul say I don’t know where Donald is coming from. Trump is exposing how we are already ruled by a ONE PARTY OLIGARCHY, that chooses who will be President. This time Trump is confounding their agenda. Trump is revealing how they are all lying to us & of course they all really support Hillary or a 3rd party candidate. Aren’t they the ones who say “Anyone but Trump”? JC Teecher   Look at the bright side, even though it is just a dying ember of one, this brings the chosen one to the final phase of taking her pedestal of satanic hierarchy in ussag, and will eliminate the need for martial law in order to stave off the trump charge.   I still believe we will see bank failures and an economic collapse whereby she will pull the exact same stunts as Odrama did, to filter off funds, but; I think it will stabilize after the “haircut” to the upper middle class wealth.   The con game continues at a much more rapid and rabid pace. themacabre   If there was ever a situation that demanded a special prosecutor, this was it. How could the Valerie Plame joke get a special prosecutor and not this obvious case of criminal wrong doing? Of course, the criminal wrong doing was, and is, obvious…there was no way Obozo would have sanctioned a special prosecutor. Yes, July 5, 2016, will go down in history when America officially became a banana republic, and Ms Evita Peron Clinton will be crowned El Presidente in January, 2017. df NJ   Hillary is the most corrupt politician in my lifetime. She needs to go to jail. Horiboyable .   Or hunt her down like the Libyan leader and give her the Gaddafi treatment OTAY   In my time it was the O.J. Simpson verdict. df NJ   You conservatives are a funny bunch. Your answer to everything is to cut taxes, have a smaller government, and the World will be a better place. But if you ever return to reality based politics, look at the recent years between California and Kansas. In CA, they raised taxes and increased minimum wage and now they have a budget surplus. In Kansas, Brownback implemented traditional Republican policies. The rich got huge tax breaks. And their pockets are bulging. And now the state is bankrupt. Nice job Republicans. Jerry C   California and Kansas a success? Quoting Bill Maher & liberal leftists garbage rags for news doesn’t make it reality. More businesses and people are moving out as fast as they can. Who wants to work when they’re being taxed to death? Only the workers. You. Are. Clueless. faith   It’s going from bad to worse if she wins. But God….. Don’t lose heart or the faith. Pray against the wickedness in high places using the weapons from God;s word. If she gets in keep praying if not keep praying. The bible says to pray without ceasing. It’s only a day, God can do so much in a millisecond to make a change. We don’t even know what tomorrow will be like we are only here for a moment like a mist. Hillary is only a vapor to God. She can be evaporated like nothing. df NJ   I always thought Hillary was a Christian. I can’t believe she’s a Muslim like you are saying. Son of a bi!tch! wiseup   Really?! How did you come to that conclusion? By what she says or what she does? df NJ   Well, obviously she cannot be a servant of God. Joe Trevors   The head of the CIA is a Muslim.

He’s here for attention obviously. There isn’t anything on this site that interests him except for those who give him the attention his parents failed to provide. I pity him in the sense that he feels unloved, lost, and hopeless. I see him smoking pot or washing down his antidepressants with a shot of whiskey….alone. As he ponders his life, he thinks he has it figured out, though his marks bear out the fact that he can’t handle life. And of course, after convincing himself of his uselessness, he becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy, here to incense and be fed by those who will respond. Look on him as he is: utterly lost and filled with hatred. He’s an animal to be pitied, not fed. He’s too irrational to be fed. He’ll bite…as you can see from his silly, lost, unhappy remarks. sistersoldier   For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire, And the greedy man curses and spurns the LORD. The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek Him. All his thoughts are, “There is no God.” Psalm 10:3-4   You are in fact quoting scripture when you say, “There is no God” He put in writing more than 3,000 years before you said it. rushmore   you will be the first one crying, when this all falls aprt! Preacher62   You know there is. He gave his son for you. Steeve Girard   There is one, but it’s between Abraham’s legs. Guest   No, He will not answer such prayers. For individual Americans, yes, but not the nation. He is a holy Elohim. He gives nations the leaders it deserves. I am Canadian. Look what He gave us. Bob332   THE COMEY EFFECT: We HAVE the evidence, BUT, no INTENT. Therefore, our INTENT is not to prosecute. A big shout out for -FU America, case closed. THE HITLERY EFFECT: Well America, this PROVES we are NOT equal under the law. You would be Indicted, Convicted and spending 25-Life in some Fed Pen. Remember, America you are just useful serf’s. df NJ   She’s absolutely the most corrupt politician in my lifetime. She needs to go to jail! SnohtBlossom   I’m sure she’s NOT the most corrupt politician of your lifetime. HeyAHuman   Just out of curiosity, why do you support her? SnohtBlossom   She will be our Glorious new President! Jerry C   LUITPOS is not done yet. he’ll go to the U.N. where he can destroy the whole world; America was just a stepping stone. Victor   I’ve been say all along America is lawless, no rule of law, since this guilty criminal Clinton came on the scene Steeve Girard   longer than that…. It started with throw everything out the White House windows Reagan DJohn1   That announcement by the FBI did two things. The FBI were always the untouchables that could not be bribed or intimidated. Not until yesterday at least. I think the reaction of the American People will be to elect someone else. Now if the electorial college does not follow what the people elect, then we have a real problem this time around. I think if she had won a verdict in a trial that was public then she may have been elected. This way she is damned politically forever. She never got her day in court. So people will assume she was guilty and that Bill bribed the FBI. Assume is a big word. But that is what people will do. She has just been shot in the foot politically. That is why she will never become President of this country. Her reputation is shot. That Obama is running around supporting her effort to get elected President using government transport to do so is another problem she has. When both of them are being transported on Air Force One, that is on our dime as tax payers. Trump labeled her “crooked Hilliary” and this just gave her the reputation to go with it. Only God knows the future. It is beginning to look like Trump may become President after all. Joe Trevors   Yes! Mr. Cipher   Half the population couldn’t care less is she is crooked as long as the welfare checks keep coming. illusion   Relax everybody and stay calm. Hillary, like all of her predecessors will be merely a puppet for the banking and global elite. I will admit that she is a vial person. Fortunate for her, we have a rather stupid populace in this country that cannot see through her campaign facade. Hillary and Bill will continue their charade in office. It will be all about them and theirs (bankers), who will call the shots. World War 3 is a real distinct possibility with this charlatan in the Oval Office. Would anybody care to wager on another false flag event similar if not worse to 9-11 to further an agenda? This time, we can place the false blame on the Syrians to foster the belief that we need troops on the ground. HeyAHuman   Condition people to accept blatant corruption. Condition them to accept that the elite are above the law, and that justice is not blind. How much more will we accept? df NJ   I would be happy if we just enforced our existing banking and monopoly laws. tempus.fugit   RE: what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton?   Nishimura confessed. It’s that simple.   All Western systems of law, whether full adversarial, full discovery, or something in between, have always relied upon testament of self-confession or the force to exact it in the absence of confession.   Nishimura self-recognized his actions, self-classified them, and confessed them. That he confessed them with the emotion of wrong-doing is his. In contrast, Hillary has not confessed, nor is she capable of self-recognition of her actions, let alone classifying them, or even classifying them as bad. To give testament of null-value is why we don’t give guns to children: they cannot self-pay the price of learning the lesson, so they don’t learn. Self-confession is inherently predicated on the sensing of cost and the ability to pay it. Children don’t confess; they can’t; even if they admit spoken guilt, they do not feel it, nor give it any recognition that those who pay do.   Grant the unable credit as if they are able, and you’ll only end up backrupt, with decades of time lost, and not one shred of gratitude nor remorse from those who took credit they were unable to pay. Oz Steamer   “o what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton?” Firstly, Nishimura was (is?) MALE, and Hillary is a woman. Secondly, anyone who thinks the Feminists want “equality” only has to look at this decision. If Hillary was a man, she’d be in prison, by now. The Feminists (especially the male ones) are trying so hard to get her to be President. The Feminists show they have never ever wanted genuine equality, only to bash men, and to get away with what can only be described as “obvious criminal behavior”.   For any religious person, the choice is clear: go with Feminism, and Hillary or go with religion and oppose her and Feminism. Pick one.   I fear the US election is already Hillary’s as the Republicans are clearly trying to destroy Donald Trump, and to win against your own Party elite and against Hillary and the media (who automatically side with Hillary) would be an impossible task.   God Help America if Hillary wins. Mr. Cipher   Ya but she’s offering free college and other goodies. Horiboyable .   You knew the fix was in because Obama had already come out and said he would support Hillary’s bid before FBI director James Comey made his announcement. Seriously what type of women would stay with a man that gets BJs from interns!! I tell you what type, a women that would sell her mothers eyeballs in their lust for power. Folks with this decision the line has been clearly drawn in the sand if you would like to see it. It is THEM against US. You are free to chose not to see reality but you are not free to avoid the consequences of reality. bobbi   She stays with him because who else would want her? XSANDIEGOCA J B   I’m not shocked or surprised. I would have more surprised if she wasn’t handed a Get out of jail free card. It’s should be quite to others now, who owns the Monopoly Board. retired22   Perhaps what will save us is the gigantic financial correction coming down on,…a financial correction that will cripple the Welfare State & destroy political Washington! Unfortunately,…this will give us a whole new set of problems! Barry   Let’s all just admit to ourselves that the Clintons (and maybe others) must’ve threatened Mr. Comey into kowtowing to their will and not recommend these charges. No doubt a death threat against him or his family was made to convince him to accede to their will. Now, Ms. Lynch can easily just say that the FBI has recommended not to pursue an indictment, so she will just let the matter drop off the radar. How convenient. Dead bodies have been left in the wake of the Clintons since Arkansas. If you don’t believe me, just ask Larry Nichols. JC Teecher   I don’t know of anyone that would not lie and turn against their work ethic/patriotism to prevent the possible death of one of their own little ones.   comey is no different. He has to live with what he did as well as lyin lynch. Some people have no conscience though, much less a soul. voltaic   While you allwere silent as a mouse when GWB was not convicted for lying America into an endless war over fake WMDs…… You sense of ‘justice’ is remarkable…. Jerry C   Your New York Times reported we did find WMDs in Iraq. What about Clinton who voted to attack Iraq on the same information Bush was given? In addition, it was Bush’s advisor appointee from Clinton’s administration who told him. Ah, the facts again. Cal   Signs a nation is under judgment are many, two in particular come to mind. Sorceries, the primary definition is obvious but the secondary meaning derived from the Greek Pharmakeia (Pharmacy in English). A drug epidemic has struck this country exceeding the 1960’s killing thousands and women rulers. Hillary will no doubt win this election because the devil ordains it and America is under judgment. Obama is the stepping stone to the tribulation and the return of Bill and Hillary to the WH will destroy what is left of the United States during the tribulation. America is not mentioned anywhere in biblical prophecy and the reasons are obvious. For evil to prosper good men do nothing. Good men did nothing to stop the Warren Court, escalation of the Vietnam War and the drug saturated counter culture…the proverbial Pandora’s Box and the beginning of the end of the greatest nation on earth. Preacher62   Truth right there except for the part about the greatest nation. This nation has always been about lawlessness and greed from the outset dropping off smallpox laced blankets killing millions of native americans to all the unjust wars especially the civil war declared to the millions murdered by abortion. If the blood of Abel cried out to God from the ground, how loud is the screaming he is hearing from this country. bobbi   Hillary will president not by election but by corruption. black heart   Rush likened the Comey cave-in to that of Chief Justice John Roberts on the Obamacare challenge, effectively rewriting the law so Obama would have his victory. Good comparison, but I believe the Comey-cave is more in tune with FBI AD James Kallstrom when, under pressure from Clinton, he covered up the TWA 800 shoot down. After Kallstrom retired, he reportedly suffered sever mental anguish.   By a twist of fate, Comey was at a pivot point in history. It fell to him the the task of saving western civilization. He failed, he sold out and this will haunt him.   Hillary will be elected. Any Democrat starts with some 200-210 electoral votes. In her first term, after she grants citizenship to millions of invaders and invites millions more, we have been effectively PRI-ed as in Mexico’s forever ruling national party, except for a minor break of 12 years. The Republicans will never again control the Oval office or the senate or the house. Thank you Comey, you hack, you political flack.   Until now the idea of session was a mere discussion point. Texas will get serious after Hillary’s inauguration. Will Texas get out? Probably not. JB   Sad day indeed, Michael. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: the only thing that will change things is if the church in this country is on its knees in constant prayer, praying for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and spiritual revival. That’s why none of this makes any sense – it’s a spiritual battle (“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” Ephesians 6:12). The wicked prosper while the righteous suffer, but Christ didn’t promise Christians a life free of persecution (“no servant is above his master” Matthew 10:24). Hillary gets away while Christians are fined and imprisoned for refusing to bake a cake – or take a photograph. Wrong has become right and right has become wrong (Isaiah 5:20). It’s becoming like the days of Lot or Noah, marked by violence, immorality – and lawlessness. Yet God holds the hearts of all rulers in His hands (Proverbs 21:1) – just as He hardened Pharoah’s heart. He’s still in charge and in control – as a believer, if you want things to change, you have free access to the control room of the universe.   Dark times indeed – and like Habakkuk, we can be dismayed – but the righteous shall live by faith! (Habakkuk 2:4, Hebrews 10:38) sistersoldier   Amen JB. Scorners seem to believe that the earth needs to be in a complete catastrophic upheaval before the Lord’s return. Also, there are those who identify with the household of faith that believe God is merciful and that they will not see or experience His wrath. True, God did not appoint us (His elect) to wrath but when He is ready to chastise a NATION one method He will use is to give our enemies power over us. He did it with Israel and the U.S. is no more blessed than the apple of His eye.   Life will seemingly be normal upon Christ’s second coming. Natural disasters will precede Him stepping down on the Mt. of Olives but life will continue to thrive until those who are alive and remain see Him face to face. “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.…” JC Teecher   Good to see you sister.   The days of the entrance of Antichrist/Satan has been dramatized by the ignorant to the point that some people will be expecting an ugly man with horns and wearing red flannel underwear, while sporting a pitch fork and serpent’s tail.   To the contrary, he will be an awesome looking man in his early thirties, with similarities as we have been shown as to what Christ may have looked like, before he was imprisoned and beaten. He will be speaking scriptures, and seem so Holy, with signs of power around him. In fact, the biggest sign was revealed to me and I’m gonna share with you real soon, maybe today.   What people don’t understand is the fact that he will be impersonating Christ and come in “peacefully and prosperously”, but will go out in a sort of blaze of demonic glory, after killing the two witnesses. That brings about the end of this age. sistersoldier   Welcome back JC! I hope you had the opportunity to relax and catch plenty of fish. It’s good to see you posting again as well! Yes, I believe that it will be as you said or as the Bible says which agrees with your statement.   The Antichrist will indeed be “fiercely attractive” with a an irresistible charismatic personality. He will represent all that the world worships. Especially those who don’t know the One True God.   Isaiah 53 describes Jesus as just the opposite of the way pictures and movies portray Him. The deception began centuries ago with a false image of the true Savior’s likeness.   The prophet said that our Lord had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Preacher62   Food for thought and simply my opinion, not being argumentative. The ant-christ is not a person but a spirit just as the kingdom of God is within those who belong to him,(Luke 17) the spirit of anti-christ is within those who belong to Satan. I believe the teaching of a literal and physical anti-christ to be a distraction from the truth. We are told time and again in the scripture to examine ourselves to see if Christ is in us and if he is not then we have failed the test of Christianity.   Teaching that there is a literal anti-christ keeps many looking “out there” for the enemy when we should be looking within for the enemy. The war that we are fighting is not against flesh and blood and it is not “out there”; the war we are fighting is within ourselves. Satan is prowling around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. This refers to Christians because all who are not Christians have already been devoured. Finally 1 John 2 tells us that MANY anti-christs had already come and that was 2000 yrs ago, there have been many since and there are many still to come I am sure.   The only real option we have is to do as the Lord commanded and Go and make disciples. This is all that will prevent them from being devoured. If we get too caught up with looking for something or someone that does not exist then we might become distracted from doing that which is necessary.   John 6:66 tells us the “mark of man” From that moment they left him and followed him no more. The “mark of God’s children” on the other hand is that they hold out faithful till the end by the grace of God.   Love and blessings JC Teecher   I see what you are saying, however; it makes me wonder if you believe that Satan is not a real entity and being held, right now, by Michael the Archangel? Preacher62   No, Satan is VERY real and the prince of this world. JC Teecher   Ok, thanks.   Many follow man’s teachings that Antichrist is a flesh man walking the earth right now, while God teaches us exactly who he is, how, and when he comes, in the book of Revelation.   I have even heard the pre-tribber Hagee say he will arise from Europe and then get shot in the head and miraculously recover and come back to life after three days. What a hoot and hogwash. Bill G Wilminton NC   Many many Christians believe in The Pre-Trib Rapture including myself.   Hagee makes many good points so does Perry Stone and others………   Hagee does believe that He(Anti-Christ) will be shot and miraculously recover……as He(Anti-Christ) Mimicks Christ.   I study both pre-trib and post-trib Rapture and I find many fallacies in the post-trib beliefs and it seems at times that the post-tribbers focus on being included in the pain and misery of the Tribulation….like they dont want to be “Left Out”. or feel that they should be LEFT OUT.   I believe that those that love The Lord are “The Bride of Christ” and one does not have their Bride get beat to a pulp and then sweep her away for the honeymoon.   There are other serious issues with the post-trib rapture.   Shalom GV   “…I study both pre-trib and post-trib Rapture and I find many fallacies in the post-trib beliefs ….”   gee, people reading the same Bible coming to totally different conclusions Bill G Wilminton NC   God said that NO ONE would KNOW the day or the hour of The Rapture….Uncertain by Design.   BUT ” For A Man to Lie with A Man As With a Woman Is an Abomination In The Eyes Of The Lord ” Sorry GV No Uncertainty There. GV   your “god” ordered the murder of children and babies. Sorry Bill, no uncertainly there JB   I agree with your personification of the anti-Christ – many mistake “anti” to mean someone who is gruesome and abhorrent, but in the Greek (which is more precise) translates into “in place of Christ” – in other words, Satan creates his counterfeit (as he always has – he tries to imitate what God does with his own version) and we’ll have a man arrive on the scene who the entire world embraces and some will mistake for the Messiah. Like Satan, he will want to be worshipped. JC Teecher   The thing is, Satan is, or shall i say, will be, the Antichrist. All others that have come in the “spirit” of antichrist, have been men…flesh men.   Satan will come looking as a man, even a flesh man, but will be spirit bodied. JB   True, God has and does judge corporately (and some day individuals). Many examples of that in His Word. Our country has been given a lot of truth – as what was once a Christian nation – and to “whom much is given, much will be expected.” Nationally, we’ve also been blessed because of a promise He made to Abraham (“those who bless you, I will bless”). What’s unique about that is we were blessed – not because of anything we did (because we’re certainly no longer living righteously) – but because of a promise He made. But as we continue to turn our backs on Israel, that goes away and there’s really nothing left to stay His judgment – except the prayers of believers.   But yes, that was also something that astounded Habakkuk – he wanted God to pour some wrath on Israel and when God showed him that he was going to bring the Chaldeans on them (for they were incredibly barbaric), Habakkuk didn’t like that much, but the Lord responded that He is free to use whoever He chooses as His “war club.”   I think generally things will tend to get worse, though. Man says he is evolving and getting better, but if you read Paul’s letters to Timothy, he describes terrible times in the last days and a very wicked generation. df NJ   It would be nice if corporations would go to Hell. sistersoldier   Yes and Amen. The Bible submits the question, “Will the Son of Man (Jesus) find faith on the earth when He returns?” A testimony as to how wicked mankind will have become in the latter days.   If I may tag team on your comment about the blessing of Abraham. Abraham is considered to be the father of faith. He believed God and it was counted unto him as righteousness. We know this because Abraham obeyed the voice of God.The first seed which carried the promise to bless all nations was the seed of faith. Faith (in God) is the seed that God can bless and still be true to His word as we know that not all of Abraham’s descendants were righteous but his faith was pure. America has rejected the God of the Word and the promise and thereby have chosen to forfeit the blessings.   What a mighty and a Righteous God we serve. df NJ   So we are all Jews first. Got it. Preacher62   Actually only those who belong to God are Jews. Repent and believe the Gospel and you can be a Jew as well. (Romans 2:28–29) “28 For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision. 29 No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by God’s Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people.” sistersoldier   NO! I don’t!. God’s Word affirms that the Jews are God’s chosen people: “You are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession” (Deuteronomy 7:6). From eternity past God knew that He would need to be born into the human race in order to save us from the spiritually dead condition that we were in (Ephesians 1—2; Genesis 3). God had planned from the beginning to be born into a very small nation or race of people called the Jews. JC Teecher   The Lord works in mYsterious ways, sister.
