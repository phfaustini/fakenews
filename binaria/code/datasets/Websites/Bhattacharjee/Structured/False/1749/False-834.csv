October 27, 2016 Masculinity   An interesting thought recently crossed my mind. What would have happened if I stumbled across the manosphere in my late teens?   Back when I was a blue-pill high school greenhorn, clueless about women and with a mind set on “neutral,” I was destined to be just another cog in the big government machine. Simply put, I would have been the dog’s bollocks.   But having all these resources served on a silver platter would not have given me the hunger that I have for life today. I would take this things as granted instead of considering every opportunity as the last one.   Dwelling on those thoughts is not good. What I can do is to keep writing so other young people and lost men turn their life around for the better. If I must condense the most useful things I have learnt: On Game Logistics are key   Get a private room or an apartment within 20 minutes walk of the date location or party district. Check that the security will not cockblock you. Have alcohol and music ready at your place. Clean it. Have condoms stashed. Get taxi numbers, a local SIM card etc.   Related: How Bad Logistics Can Ruin Your Game Keep an abundance mentality   Stop “over-pursuing” as Quintus puts it. The sheer number of women cruising around prevents you from being needy. Showing this weakness to women NEVER works in your favour.   Next the time wasters. If it is not her, it will be another. Stop dwelling in the past, stop keeping the number of dysfunctional girls from previous bangs. Keep moving forward.

Who cares if you mumbled a bit. Smirk and carry on.   If you don’t act, the opportunity is gone. Don’t count to three. You see, you jump.   Related: How To Get Over Your Anxiety When Approaching Women Always escalate   Never apologise for being a man with a healthy sex life or hesitate to be sexual. If she calls you out, double down, fuck it. You are not here for a peck on the cheek or listen about her output on life.   One of the sentence that stayed with me and still is in a corner of my head to this day is “Think of it as the last time you see her.”   Related:",0.0
