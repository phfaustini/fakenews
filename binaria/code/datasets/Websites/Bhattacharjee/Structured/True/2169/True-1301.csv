When terrorists attack people for drawing Muhammed, the intent isn't just to kill these people: it's to create a deterrent to anyone who might, in the future, use their speech rights in a way that radical Islamists don't like. Writer Timothy Garton Ash calls this the ""assassin's veto:"" the idea that killers can use fear to put limits on free speech.    Nothing makes that threat feel more real than gunfire literally interrupting an address meant to defend free speech.",1.0
