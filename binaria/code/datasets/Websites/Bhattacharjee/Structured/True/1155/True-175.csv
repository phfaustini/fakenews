Colin Powell, who served under three Republican presidents, called Donald Trump ""a national disgrace"" and an ""international pariah"" in a personal email, BuzzFeed News reported.    According to the outlet, the June 17 email to Emily Miller, a journalist who was once Powell's aide, took steely aim at the GOP nominee, saying he ""is in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him"" – and at Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whom Powell wrote ""is calibrating his position again.""    BuzzFeed reported the website DCLeaks.com — which has reported but unconfirmed ties to Russian intelligence services — obtained Powell's emails. BuzzFeed reported it has seen the posts.    According to the outlet, in an Aug. 21 email, Powell blasted Trump for embarking on a ""racist"" movement insinuating President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.    ""Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,"" Powell wrote, according to BuzzFeed. ""That's what the 99 percent believe. When Trump couldn't keep that up, he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim.    ""As I have said before, 'What if he was?' Muslims are born as Americans everyday.""    Powell also derided former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who advises Trump, saying the sex scandal-plagued executive would hurt Trump's chances among women voters.    ""And Ailes as an advisor won't heal women, don't you think?'"" Powell wrote, per BuzzFeed.    According to BuzzFeed News, the other emails included:    BuzzFeed said Powell responded to the emails by saying: ""I have no further comment. I'm not denying it.""",1.0
