Rand Paul (R-Ky) spoke at a historically black college around here, it didn't go well.    Paul spoke at Howard University nearly two years ago, a trip that was filled with fumbles. He bungled the name of Edward Brooke, a Howard graduate who was the nation's first black Senator elected since Reconstruction, and asked if the audience knew the NAACP was founded by Republicans.    Friday, he came here to Bowie State University, another historically black college -- and this time, he came as a politician who seemed to have found his footing when it came to talking about race.    Paul was greeted with a standing ovation and his points were peppered with applause from the audience, a cross-section of races and ages. And some people liked what he had to say.    Shaniah Haskins, an 18-year-old freshman criminal justice major at Bowie State, said she'd wanted to hear Paul's views on the system.    ""The simple fact is he'd change things for minorities based not just on race, but on other factors,"" including economic status, she said. ""He actually seems like he has a lot of ideas.""    Over the past few years, Paul has made criminal justice reform one of his signature issues. More recently, he's tied the call for reducing arrests and changing sentencing laws to the situation in Ferguson, Mo.    Speaking just days after the release of a scathing Department of Justice report that showed the Ferguson police department engaged in a systemic pattern of racial discrimination -- and the shooting of two officers -- Paul focused his remarks again Friday on reforming the criminal justice system. He spent about an hour at Bowie State University, about 18 miles from Washington. The visit there underscored one of Paul's goals as he ramps up to a universally expected announcement that he will run for president: reaching out to young and African-American voters.    Paul evoked Martin Luther King's ""Two Americas"" speech, and said that the split still exists, and by not reforming the criminal justice system the nation will stay divided.    ""There is still significant segregation in our society,"" Paul said.    In Ferguson, Paul said, there are about 10,000 more arrests each year than the total population of the city. The frustration that is boiling over isn't only due to the killing of an unarmed black teenager by police there, or the death of a black man selling loose cigarettes in New York City, but because of longstanding disparities in the criminal justice system. .    ""It isn't just about what happened this year. It's about this building up,"" he said. ""I call it an undercurrent of unease in this country. There are still two Americas.""    Paul's remarks are likely a preview of how he will handle issues of race and criminal justice should he jump into the presidential race. He often speaks of a trip he made to Ferguson last year, where he met with community leaders. He discussed it, unease he said he found in Ferguson and King's speech at a dinner for the American Prospect Magazine last month.    ""You're not a part of that,"" he said to an audience that include billionaire David Koch, ""But imagine what it's like to be poor and to get a $100 fine and to have interest added to that and to have it be a $200 fine and we're putting people in jail for civil fines. We've got to figure out what justice is.""    At Bowie State, Paul told stories of people who had been put in jail unfairly due to mandatory minimums or because they couldn't afford to fight the system. Sentencing disparities aren't purposeful, he said, but ""are actual and real.""    Felony convictions, he said, are the ""number one"" thing that prevent people from voting, and he said that expunging criminal records for minor offenses would help the economy by making it easier for people to get jobs.    ""Criminal justice, or the lack of criminal justice, it's not a black or white problem,"" Paul said. ""It's a poverty problem.""",1.0
