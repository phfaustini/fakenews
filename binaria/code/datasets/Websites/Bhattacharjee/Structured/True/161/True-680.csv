Ernst was speaking at the ""Roast & Ride"" event in Des Moines, Iowa, that she hosted. Trump later addressed the audience; he did not address Ernst's remarks.    ""Hillary Clinton has given us so much to talk about really in the email scandal and her policies overseas. Really, she has a record of failure. Let's talk about that record of failure. We can focus on issues, not name-calling,"" Ernst said.    ""I don't like it when campaigns go that direction. I'd say to both of them, back down. And let's really talk about the policies and the issues. That's my advice to them,"" Ernst was quoted in The Post. Ernst's comments come after Trump was criticized for calling Clinton a ""bigot"" at a campaign rally, and repeatedly refused to back down from the claims. ""That is not acceptable to be doing the name-calling back and forth,"" Ernst said. ""We need to focus on the issues. He has given voice to millions of American and there's something there. Americans feel that their voice is not being heard and he has really given her a platform, let's focus on the failures of Hillary Clinton,"" Ernst told CNN.",1.0
