Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., victories over their parties' front-runners.    Did Trump's abortion comments and his attacks on Gov. Scott Walker hurt him in Wisconsin? Click play for CBN News Chief Political Correspondent David Brody's take on Tuesday's primary results.    That means contested party conventions may be more likely this summer for the Republicans and maybe even the Democrats.    It wasn't a knock-out punch, but Cruz delivered a major blow to Donald Trump's effort to secure enough delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination before the GOP convention.    ""God bless the great state of Wisconsin!"" Cruz exclaimed Tuesday before a group of his supporters.    Wisconsin Republicans gave him the nod over Trump, 48 percent to 35 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in a disappointing and distant third, winning only 14 percent of the vote.    Cruz said he is truly unifying the Republican Party.    ""Tonight is a turning point,"" he said. ""It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America. We have a choice. A real choice.""    Meanwhile, Trump responded saying there's no party unity -- just an anti-Trump initiative led by the GOP establishment.    But American voters may now be moving toward favoring Cruz over Trump. A new Reuters poll shows the Texas lawmaker leading Trump for the first time nationally, 39 to 37 percent.    He still needs to win 1,237 delegates to get the nomination. After Wisconsin, Trump has 740 delegates, Cruz has 514 and Kasich only 143.    Meanwhile on the Democratic side, Badger State voters made Hillary Clinton ""feel the Bern.""    Moments after he learned he had defeated Clinton in Wisconsin, Sanders shouted, ""We won in Wisconsin!"" during a campaign rally in Wyoming.    The Vermont Democratic socialist senator decisively beat Clinton by 10 points, with almost 57 percent of the vote to her to 43 percent.    Sanders said he's proving his effort is not just a fringe campaign.    ""We have now won seven out of the eight last caucuses and primaries,"" he explained.    But Sanders still needs to win about 67 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination -- 2,383 are needed. Currently, Clinton has 1,743, while Sanders has 1,056.    While the momentum may now favor Sanders and Cruz, it can quickly change in political campaigns. Both Trump and Clinton are expected to win their home state of New York when voters go to the polls for that primary in two weeks.",1.0
