She courted Hispanic voters in Washington as Donald Trump talked economics in New York.    Trump unveiled more details of his plan to move the U.S. economy forward.    ""We must replace the present policy of globalism, which has just taken so many jobs out of our communities and so much wealth out of our country, and replace it with a new policy of Americanism,"" he explained.    Trump said as president, he will act to tap into the ""un-realized potential"" of American workers and their dreams. He pledged to create 25 million new jobs and grow the economy over 10 years at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent.    U.S. economic growth under President Barack Obama has never reached 3 percent in any one year -- something that's never happened under any other U.S. president.    ""I am going to lower your taxes very, very substantially. I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulation. All of these regulations on your business, and in your life,"" Trump insisted.    Afterwards, Trump appeared on the ""Tonight Show."" In a lighter moment, host Jimmy Fallon made one request of the Republican presidential nominee, asking him,Â  ""Can I mess your hair up? Did you say yes?""    Trump responded, ""Go ahead!"" Fallon then proceeded to dishevel Trump's hair.    Meanwhile, Clinton was back on the campaign trail in the nation's capital, with the James Brown tune, ""I Feel Good,"" blasting from loud speakers.    Fresh from three-and-a-half days off resting from pneumonia, she spoke to the National Hispanic Caucus in Washington, D.C.    Clinton wasted little time renewing her attacks against Trump, going after him for telling the Washington Post he didn't want to answer the question right now of whether or not the president was born in the United States.    ""This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?"" she asked rhetorically. ""If we just sigh, shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are?""    The Trump campaign later conceded that he does believe the president was born in the United States.    Even though polls show many voters don't like either candidate, Clinton is facing an enthusiasm gap.    Only 50 percent of Trump's supporters say they're excited to vote for him. The percentage of Clinton supporters is even less, with only 43 percent saying they're excited about her.    Enthused or not, with less than two months to go before Election Day, both candidates know independent voters hold the key to winning the White House.    And Clinton says there's another important factor.    ""What matters is who registers to vote and who is motivated and mobilized to turnout to vote,"" she said.",1.0
