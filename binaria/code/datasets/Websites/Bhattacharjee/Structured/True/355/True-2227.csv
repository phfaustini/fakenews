Donald Trump completed a five-state sweep in Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, while Hillary Clinton won four out of the five states, losing only Rhode Island to her rival Bernie Sanders.    Now the two front-runners are beginning to shift their focus, with each expecting to go up against the other in the General Election.    ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she would get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she has got going is the woman's card,"" Trump told supporters.    Clinton fired back, saying, ""Well, if fighting for women's healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the 'woman's card,' then deal me in!""    The former secretary of state now has nearly 90 percent of the delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, and after a sweep of Tuesday's primaries, Trump is one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.    Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are hoping their alliance to stay out of each other's way in Indiana, Oregon, and New Mexico will help slow down Trump's momentum and block him from winning the nomination before the convention.    ""I got good news for you tonight. This campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,"" Cruz told his supporters.    Currently, Trump has 950 delegates, Cruz has 560, and Kasich has 153. It takes 1,237 to win the nomination.    Meanwhile on the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders refuses to go quietly into the night.    ""The fight we are waging is not an easy fight, but I know you are prepared to wage that fight,"" the Vermont lawmaker told supporters.    The candidates now move on to Indiana, with Sanders, Cruz, and Trump all holding events there Wednesday.    With Kasich pulling back in the Hoosier State, Cruz will basically have a shot at a one-on-one race against Trump. But if he loses, it could turn out to be his last stand.",1.0
