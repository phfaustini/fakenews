Germany has been receiving up to 10,000 migrants per day, but that can't go on for long.    Meanwhile, some lawmakers in the United States warn President Barack Obama's recent decision to receive more refugees could lead to another major terror attack.    One of the top destinations for Syrian refugees, Germany originally opened its doors to the migrants fleeing from their countries.    Now, it's implementing temporary border controls, with many calling it a strong message to the rest of the European Union to step up and start shouldering some of the burden.    ""There's a need for shelters and care and I hope it will start during the next days. Munich can do a lot but we can't accomplish it all by ourselves,"" Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, said.    Stephan Bauman, the head of World Relief, an evangelical non-profit that cares for refugees and immigrants, is calling on the U.S. government to allow 200,000 refugees into the country. Bauman is also calling on every U.S. church congregation to adopt a refugee family. Watch his interview with CBN News.    German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that according to EU rules, his country isn't technically responsible for the migrants.    They're supposed to be registered and processed in the first EU country they arrive in. De Maiziere's urging other countries to apply those rules and stop allowing the people seeking protection to choose the country they get it from.    Many migrants have refused to register in countries like Greece or Hungary because they're afraid it would keep them from being granted asylum in other EU states.    Germany suspended train services to and from Austria for 13 hours and is now imposing strict document checks for people entering the country.    Officials say such measures are necessary for Germany to limit the number of people coming in and reinstate a more orderly entry process.    Meanwhile, some American lawmakers are voicing concern that President Obama's decision to allow 10,000 refugees to be brought to the United States will put the country in danger.    ""I take ISIS at its word when they said, in their words, 'We'll use and exploit the refugee crisis to infiltrate the West.' That concerns me,"" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, told ABC's ""This Week.""    McCaul said that while the United States is a compassionate nation, this move by the president could be a very ""reckless and dangerous policy.""    He also said the United States has already disrupted a security threat to Pope Francis's upcoming visit to Washington.    Over the weekend, al Qeada's leader called on young Muslim men to carry out lone wolf attacks in America and other Western countries.",1.0
