In all, the Clinton campaign has raised $112 million for the primary since launching in April. Heading into 2016, the campaign has roughly $38 million cash on hand, according to aides.    The haul, which is larger than even some Clinton aides expected, puts a big number on the board that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- her main primary challenger -- is unlikely to top.    ""Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement on Friday.    ""Helping Democratic candidates win up and down the ticket is a top priority for Hillary Clinton which is why she's also proud to be doing her part to ensure Democrats have the resources we need to win."" CNN reported earlier this week that Clinton raised at least $21 million at fundraisers she personally headlined in the fourth quarter of 2015, a number that almost guaranteed she would break the $100 million goal. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. The labor-intensive process, which required Clinton to criss-cross the country on both the campaign and fundraising trail, saw the former secretary of state headline fundraisers in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Thirteen events were in New York, the most of any state, and six were in California. The fourth quarter also saw Clinton get more help than usual on the fundraising trail. Former President Bill Clinton headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter. While it will be difficult for Sanders to turn in a bigger haul than Clinton, the Vermont senator is expected to bring in a sizable haul, largely buoyed by his strong online contributions. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has solicited over 2.3 million donations and raised over $40 million -- including a sizable $26 million in the third quarter. Aides have said that the campaign is focused on surpassing 1 million donors by the end of the year. Like Clinton, Sanders also signed a joint fundraising effort with the DNC this quarter, starting to raise money for the national party in November. Clinton aides boasted on Friday that 94% of their donations were in increments of $100 or less and more than 60% of donations were from women.
