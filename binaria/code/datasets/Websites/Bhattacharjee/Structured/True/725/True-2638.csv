Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.”    This was a convention in which the word “we” was invoked by speaker after speaker, from President Obama to the Rev. William Barber as a talisman and a commitment. In the hour before Clinton spoke, Barber gave a stirring stem-winder of a sermon that ended with the whole convention shouting “Alleluia!”    Clinton embraced the communitarian theme, signaling that her “Stronger Together” slogan would remain at the heart of her campaign.    “Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger,” she declared. “None of us can do it alone. That’s why we are stronger together.”    And she underscored the other side of that catchphrase by warning that Trump would divide the nation.    “Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart,” she said. “Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It’s truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together.”    As she often has in the past, Clinton cited as her guiding principle a favorite teaching from her Methodist faith: “Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.”    She included a lengthy tribute to Bernie Sanders, whom she praised for having “put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.”    And she pledged to live up to the hopes that inspired their engagement. “Your cause,” she said, “is our cause.”    She struck populist themes that should resonate with Sanders’s backers. “Wall Street can never ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again,” Clinton said. She attacked big money in politics and promised fairer trade deals, a higher minimum wage and an expansion of Social Security benefits. It was a speech that ratified the progressive thrust of the party’s platform and its move in a more progressive direction.    Her speech capped a star-studded, thematically coherent and methodically organized convention that contrasted sharply with a shambolic Trump gathering in Cleveland that most leading Republicans shunned.    She faced the challenge of following a passionately persuasive address on her behalf by Obama, much as Obama had to follow a similarly successful speech by Bill Clinton four years ago.    Her style was very different from Obama’s. She spoke quietly, deliberately and often affectingly, particularly when discussing her mother, who was abandoned by her parents and “was saved by the kindness of others.” It was a powerful speech in which she combined the personal with policy, a vigorous defense of the Obama record with an insistence that she would tackle the problems left unsolved and the injustices that still needed righting.     Again and again, she came back to Trump’s shortcomings and hypocrisies. She charged he was “in the pocket of the gun lobby” and displayed that her party is no longer fearful of the gun issue.    Sounding a theme her campaign has signaled it will drive home, she highlighted Trump’s failure to pay many who had worked for him — “People who did the work and needed the money, and didn’t get it – not because he couldn’t pay them, but because he wouldn’t pay them.”    And she noted Trump’s statement: “I know more about ISIS than the generals do . . .”  She clearly enjoyed reciting the next line: “No, Donald, you don’t.”    In the primaries, Trump’s opponents were fearful of attacking him until it was too late. Clinton showed she would be a happy warrior with no compunction about taking him on.    Democrats have often criticized themselves as putting too much faith in policy. She embraced her persona as someone who proudly sweated policy details. And she promised a campaign rooted in a moral challenge to her opponent: “Yes, the world is watching what we do.”",1.0
