""If we cannot verify that they are not going to obtain a nuclear weapon— that there's a breakout period so that even if they cheated we would be able to have enough time to take action — if we don't have that kind of deal, then we're not going to take it,"" the president said in an interview onCBS' Face the Nation.    ""If there's no deal,"" Obama said, ""then we walk away.""    The United States and its allies have until March 24 to reach an agreement with Iran. Obama wants to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while still allowing the country to enrich uranium to use for energy production.    ""Over the next month or so, we're going to be able to determine whether or not their system is able to accept what would be an extraordinarily reasonable deal if in fact, as they say, they are only interested in peaceful nuclear programs,"" Obama told correspondent Bill Plante. ""And if we have unprecedented transparency in that system, if we are able to verify that in fact they are not developing weapons systems, then there's a deal to be had, but that's going to require them to accept the kind of verification and constraints on their program that so far, at least, they have not been willing to say yes to.""    He said talks with Iran, which have been going on for more than a year, have not cost the United States anything. Iran has been abiding by an interim agreement not to advance its nuclear program, the president said.    ""We're not losing anything through these talks,"" Obama said.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also appearing on Face the Nation, said he and Obama have the same ultimate goal in trying to ensure that Iran does't develop nuclear weapons. But Netanyahu said he doesn't trust that inspections will prevent the Iranians from cheating and developing weapons.    ""I do not trust inspections with totalitarian regimes,"" Netanyahu said. ""What I'm suggesting is that you contract Iran's nuclear program, so there's less to inspect.""    Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday, warning U.S. lawmakers against a deal with Iran.    The Senate must weigh in on whatever deal is reached, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.    ""The Iranians are fomenting trouble in Syria, in Lebanon, in Gaza, in Yemen,"" McConnell said on Face the Nation. ""All over the Middle East, they're on the march. They've had enhanced influence in Iraq. We can't ignore all of their other behavior in looking at the potential nuclear deal. What we do know about the deal is it looks like it will leave the (nuclear) infrastructure in place with one of the worst regimes in the world.""    McConnell said he is working to put together a veto-proof majority to support a measure giving Congress the authority to approve or disapprove of any deal.    Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agreed that Congress has a role in whatever deal may be reached.    ""Congress passed the sanctions itself, so Congress has very much an interest in the sanctions,"" Schumer said in a separate Face the Nation interview. ""I pushed that it shouldn't be done before there's an agreement...but after that, yes, Congress has a right to weigh in and I support it.""",1.0
