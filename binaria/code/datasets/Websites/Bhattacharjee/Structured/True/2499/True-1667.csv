""This is no longer demonstration management, this has turned into a riot,"" Seattle Police Captain Chris Fowler tweeted.    Police responded with pepper spray and pepper balls, eventually arresting 15 people. Protesters damaged several dozen vehicles, officers said.    ""It became violent and destructive and we had to make a move,"" Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole said during a joint press conference with Mayor Ed Murray. ""I think (officers) were very professional about how they handled the situation.""    The march was just one of several May Day demonstrations done to support workers rights and other causes in Seattle on Friday. Others were peaceful, including a Black Lives Matter March and an immigrant and workers' rights event, organized by the group El Comite.    She said the department will do a comprehensive review to make sure the use of force was appropriate.    She wouldn't go into details about the officers' injuries, but said one had a burn injury and another had an orthopedic injury. They are all ""conscious and in good spirits,"" she said.    Bicycle officers shadowed the marchers — who changed directions often through Capitol Hill — keeping them off Interstate 5 and away from downtown. Police in riot gear eventually hemmed them in at the plaza at Seattle Central College.    ""We're all here for one reason and that's to unify the people,"" said Jessica Ramirez, who was one of thousands who marched through downtown Seattle.    For University of Washington student Diana Betancourt, the day takes on a deep meaning.    ""At the age of five, my mom, two sisters and I came here, we crossed through the Arizona desert with no money, no food, in search of a better life, a better future,"" she said. ""Now I am here, a second year (student) at the University of Washington, my whole tuition paid up, making my dream come true.""    She said she can't vote and is technically a ""legal alien.""    ""It was a shameful thing that you have to grow up with, not being able to tell other people this identity of you, you have to keep it inside,"" Betancourt said. ""We're forced to keep it a secret. You don't know who to trust. You don't know who's going to help you and who's going to report you.""    Once the crowds made it to the federal courthouse in downtown, people came to the stage to discuss workers' and immigrant rights. Some speakers focused on how deportation breaks up families.    ""Seattle, everybody — I am so proud to see you all here, but we've got to keep the fight,"" said Jorge Baron of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. ""We've got to keep the fight. We've got to win. We're on the right side of justice. We are going to win.""    Other discussions turned to Baltimore, where State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby filed charges earlier in the morning in the Freddie Gray case.    ""An indictment of those six cops is not justice for Freddie Gray nor is it equity for any of us oppressed people,"" Nikita Oliver told the crowd of demonstrators. ""I'm humbled by the youth and those in the streets of Baltimore. I'm humbled by the people across the nation who have taken to the streets for equity for black folks.""",1.0
