Chris Christie is refusing to hand over $800,000 in credit-card bills as part of a probe into his travel expenses. The monitoring organization New Jersey Watchdog alleges that Christie has been costing the public a pretty penny for his travels, including an 1,800 percent increase in the governor’s security detail since he took office. “Last year, Christie traveled out-of-state more than 100 days while visiting 36 states, Mexico, and Canada, primarily to help raise $106 million in campaign contributions as chairman of the Republican Governors Association,” wrote reporter Mark Lagerkvist. Christie’s office denied the request for the American Express bills because “the monthly statements indicate the names of the Executive Protection Unit members, the number of Executive Protection Unit members, and the location of these members on a day-to-day basis.”",1.0
