Republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, considered a dark horse for the 2016 presidential race, didn’t directly answer the question.          Follow @politicalticker Follow @KilloughCNN    “I haven't spent one second thinking about any job other than the one I was hired to do,” he told CNN’s chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley.    For his answer, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who’s openly considering a 2016 presidential run, simply said “no.”    The outgoing Republican governor, who ran in the GOP presidential primary last cycle, is heading to Iowa again next week, sparking further speculation that he has his eyes on another national campaign. Perry also visited the state, which holds the first presidential primary contest, in November.    Gov. Jay Nixon, D-Missouri, said he’s focused on his job as governor, adding that he’s hopeful former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jumps in.    “We'll look forward to working with her, but we really do have a lot to get done in the next three years in the Show-Me State,” he said.    Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy of Connecticut was more direct in his response: “I am not going to be a candidate for president.”    Malloy is eligible to run for re-election this year but has not announced whether he plans to seek another term    The governors are in Washington for the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association.
