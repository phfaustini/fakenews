On Monday, House lawmakers unanimously approved the Frank Wolf Religious Freedom Act. The bill updates a 1998 law sponsored by the former Virginia congressman.    ""Nearly 20 years ago, led by U.S. Congressman Frank R. Wolf, the Congress had the foresight to make advancing the right to religious freedom a high U.S. foreign policy priority,"" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., the bill's author, said.    ""Today religious freedom is still under attack and we must upgrade our programs and methods to meet the challenges of the 21st century,"" he added.    The original law established a framework to investigate religious freedom abuses, name the world's worst violators and suggest courses of action.    The new bill will target radical jihadist groups like Nigeria's Boko Haram and the Islamic State.    ""The world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom,"" Smith said, ""a crisis that continues to create millions of victims, a crisis that undermines liberty, prosperity and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China and sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.""    The legislation now moves on to the Senate.",1.0
