Clinton’s campaign said the speech, which will be delivered in San Diego at 11.30am local time, will draw a clear line between the former secretary of state’s plans and those outlined by Trump, which include having Mexico pay for a border wall that its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, said his country would not support, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the US.    Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said the speech would outline why Trump was “fundamentally unfit” to be president.    “And you will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values – a strong contrast to Donald Trump’s incessant trash-talking of America,” Sullivan said.    Clinton’s campaign has said it expects to secure the final delegates she needs to officially become the party’s nominee after the California and New Jersey primaries on 7 June.    “She will rebuke a litany of dangerous policies that Trump has espoused,” Sullivan said, “ranging from nuclear proliferation to endorsing war crimes, from denouncing Nato to banning Muslims.    “But Clinton’s critique will go beyond specific policies and she’ll make clear that the choice in this election goes beyond partisanship. Donald Trump is unlike any presidential nominee we’ve seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job.”    Clinton’s campaign has steered its plan of attack towards Trump while fending off the other remaining Democratic hopeful, Bernie Sanders.    Clinton has 2,312 delegates, including 543 super delegates, to Sanders’ 1,545 delegates, including 44 super delegates, according to the Associated Press.    Clinton did not mention Sanders on in a Wednesday night speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey, in which she called Trump a “fraud”.    Her remarks focused on newly released documents that show Trump’s defunct business training program, Trump University, encouraged staff to target prospective students’ financial weakness in order to move them to enroll in expensive courses.    “This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud,” she said. “He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.”    The same day, Barack Obama delivered a hit on Trump in a speech in Elkhart, Indiana. The US president told his audience a Trump presidency would increase the risk of a financial crisis.    “The Republican nominee for president has already said he’d dismantle all these rules that we passed,” Obama said, referring to Wall Street reform. “That is crazy.”    Trump is also ampaigning in California. Speaking in Sacramento on Wednesday night, he responded to Obama’s claims from earlier in the day by calling the president “a total lightweight”.",1.0
