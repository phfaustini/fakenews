And in the wake of unspeakably hideous tragedy, that's very good news.    The attack Wednesday that killed 12 members of the staff, including editorial director Stephane Charbonnier, was bad enough. Allowing the thugs who carried out the massacre to kill the French satirical weekly would have been catastrophic.    Despite the deaths of most of its senior journalists, the show will go on, Richard Malka, the paper's lawyer, told Le Monde. And the newspaper plans to print 1 million copies, a figure that dwarfs its usual print run of 60,000.    In an interview on French television reported by the Guardian, Patrick Pelloux, a doctor who also writes for the paper, put his finger on why this decision is essential.    ""It's very hard,"" he said. ""We are all suffering, with grief, with fear, but we will do it anyway, because stupidity will not win.""    If Charlie Hebdo were simply to go away, he said, the death of his colleagues would have been ""for nothing.""    Charlie Hebdo stirred up controversy with its irreverent, sometimes crass take on the world. It particularly offended Muslims with its treatment of the prophet Mohammed.    Extremist zealots, not known for their senses of humor, hope to control the conversation through fear. Whether it's shooting up Paris newspaper offices, beheading journalists in the Middle East or ruthlessly and relentlessly persecuting reporters and editors in despot-ruled nations, the goal is the same: Kill the messengers and make the message go away.    But it can't.    The pen is mightier than the sword, the saying goes. But it certainly doesn't always seem that way. The power of evil people who kill without conscience can make the pen (or the keyboard) seem frail indeed, completely overmatched.    Years back, giving a commencement address at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, humorist Gene Weingarten brandished a mammoth scabbard and a tiny pen. Gene was on to something.    But the way truth continues to emerge is that there is often someone to pick up the shield of the slain colleague. Despite the sharply escalating anger of covering international flashpoints, for example, journalists continue to bear the enormous risks.    In Casablanca, Victor Laszlo (played by Paul Henreid) talks about why he believes the Nazis will never prevail: ""And what if you track down these men and kill them, what if you killed all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise up to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.""    I can't say I'm quite as sanguine as Victor was. But I'm very glad to see that Charlie Hebdo will go on.",1.0
