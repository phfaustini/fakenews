Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, is already serving a 20-year jail sentence in jail for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters while president.    The then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was elected president in 2012 after the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.    The Egyptian military deposed Morsi in 2013 following a series of street protests against his rule. In May 2014, Morsi's successor, former military chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who led the coup, won a landslide victory in presidential elections.    The Muslim Brotherhood was banned and its supporters rounded up by the thousands.    As with all capital punishment cases, the sentence will be sent to the Grand Mufti, Egypt's highest authority, for his opinion. Convictions can still be appealed, even if the Grand Mufti approves the sentencing. A decision is expected on June 2.",1.0
