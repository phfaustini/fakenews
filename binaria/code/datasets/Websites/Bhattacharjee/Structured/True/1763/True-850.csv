NEW YORK -- It's a presidential debate that can be summed up in one familiar word – huge!    Social media is swarming with talk of the debate. Clinton supporters are calling for meticulous fact-checking of Trump's comments during the debate, while Trump supporters hound Hillary for her perceived untrustworthiness. Despite abundant disagreement over who will  win the White House, everyone agrees this debate is unlike any other.         Get the latest analysis and coverage     from your trusted CBN News political team.    The first of three presidential debates began with a question on the economy and jobs. Both candidates answered the question with their ideas to boost the economy.    Donald Trump says his tax plan may benefit the wealthy but it is also ""a great thing for the middle class"" because companies would invest more in building their businesses.            He says companies want to create jobs but they often move their money overseas because ""taxes are so onerous.""    Secretary Clinton directed voters to her website for her economic plan. She brought up the site when Trump was hammering her on taxes and regulations. ""He said he's 'going into cut taxes big league. You're going to raise taxes big league. End of story.'""            Clinton retorted that she ""kind of assumed there would be a lot of these charges and claims.""    Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of not paying some of the people who have worked for him through the years. She said she is relieved her father, a small business man, never had to work for him. She said Trump ""stiffed"" thousands of small business owners and workers through the years.    Trump said tens of thousands of people have worked for him and liked it. He defended his businesses saying they have been successful. He said he'd only not pay someone if their work was unsatisfactory.    Trump stated at one point that Clinton didn't have the stamina to be president. She suggested he was referring to her gender and reminded viewers of some of his past comments about women.    She also accused Trump of being easily provoked. He defended himself saying, ""I have much better judgment than she does. I have much better temperament.""    Both candidates accused each other of starting rumors claiming President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States.    They came to somewhat of an agreement on the subject of not making people on watch-lists and no-fly lists eligible for guns.    The gun debate also centered around on-going violence between police and minorities.    Trump said America needs law and order especially in inner cities. He told viewers that blacks and Hispanics are ""living in hell because it's so dangerous.""    Both agreed something needed to be    The debate could be one of the most watched and even be among some of the highest rated programs ever.    The 2015 Super Bowl clocks in at No. 1 with 115 million viewers. The 1983 series finale of ""Mash"" brought in 106 million.    One poll estimates Monday's event could rival those numbers, topping a hundred million. Regardless of the count, it will be ""must see TV.""    ""Win. That's all I want to do is win,"" Trump said.    But for this ""outsider,"" winning won't be the result of traditional textbook strategy. Instead, he's expected to stick with what got him here: instinct and boldness.    Trump, however, will need to pass the plausibility test -- that is, whether voters see him as a president.    Many are evangelicals still trying to decide whether they will pull the lever for Trump or possibly sit this election out. But evangelical leader David Barton calls that the wrong approach.    ""We have a very selfish view of what we do with voting, and I say that in the sense of that most Christians think that voting is a right. It's not. It's a duty,"" Barton said.    And Trump's been rallying the troops in the days leading up to this debate.    It's appropriate that this first, attention-grabbing debate will be in the New York area. Both candidates feel right at home in this familiar territory.    Trump Tower is located in Manhattan, Clinton's headquarters are 20 minutes away in Brooklyn, and the debate site at Hofstra University in Hempstead is only about an hour drive.    As he has proven, Trump enjoys mixing it up and getting feisty at debates. But he doesn't typically throw the first punch. Instead, he waits until he's attacked and analysts say he's one of the best counter punchers out there. So how will Clinton get ready to rumble?    ""You have to be prepared for, like, wacky stuff that comes at you,"" she told Late night host Jimmy Kimmel. ""I am drawing on my experience from elementary school.""    While Clinton's opponent may be taking a less traditional approach to preparing for the debates, she is going by the book.    The Democratic nominee cut back campaigning last week. Sources say she's going through briefing books, rehearsing and studying clips of Trump from the Republican primary debates, taking notes of his style and what gets under his skin.    ""I run across people, partisans and non-partisans alike; they'll say, 'why are y'all working so hard? I mean your girl's going to be the next president.' Which my comment is 'oh, contraire,'"" Strider said.    ""We have a very tough race ahead of us and we have two candidates and we have two candidates' families that know how to win at the rodeo and it's going to be a tough race for both sides and they're going to go at it,"" Strider warned.    Clinton has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history. But it's hard to say how much that experience will help with an unconventional outsider like Trump.    Clinton is preparing to face some uncomfortable subjects -- from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity.    A campaign insider says her team hopes to come up with a memorable one-liner that will knock Trump off his game and stick in voters' minds.    Regarding Clinton, one of the big dangers to watch for is how she will react to Trump's attacks. She's been known to get agitated pretty quickly so keeping a calm, cool demeanor will be vitally important in this debate for the ages.",1.0
