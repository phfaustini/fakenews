Two unidentified people were killed, a third injured, and 15 others detained. Police found four AK-47 assault rifles, explosives, and police uniforms inside the apartment. No police or members of the public were harmed. Separately, a Belgian arms dealer turned himself in on Thursday during a different raid in Charleroi, but police have made no connections to last week’s attacks in Paris that left 17 dead. Local media outlets reported the dealer was suspected of supplying the weapons used in a French supermarket siege, however, police are still investigating a possible connection. “For the moment, we certainly can’t confirm a link,” said Eric Van der Sypt, a spokesman for the office of the Belgian federal prosecutor.
