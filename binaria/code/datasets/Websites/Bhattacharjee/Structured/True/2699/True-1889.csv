""America is going to be better off for what he's done.""    Duncan leaves the administration as the longest-serving education secretary in U.S. history, Obama said.    ""It's a record that I truly believe that no other education secretary can match,"" he said. ""Arne bleeds this stuff. He cares so much about our kids. And he's been so passionate about this work.""    While speaking about the impact his parents -- both educators -- had on him, Duncan got emotional.    ""All our lives we saw what kids could do when given a chance, and that's why we do this today,"" he said. Obama has selected Deputy Secretary of Education John B. King, Jr. to replace him. In an internal memo to Department of Education staff, Duncan cited the commute between his home and family in Chicago in announcing his departure and called his job the ""greatest honor of my life."" ""We have been lucky to have an a amazing team here from Day One, but I honestly believe our team today is the strongest it's ever been,"" Duncan wrote. ""So it's with real sadness that (I) have come to recognize that being apart from my family has become too much of a strain, and it is time for me to step aside and give a new leader a chance."" Obama brought Duncan with him to Washington from Chicago, where he served as the city's schools chief. He's long been one of the president's closest friends in the administration, their relationship forged in the days before either came to national prominence. Duncan, along with Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and senior advisers Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, formed a hometown crowd for the Obamas when they arrived to the White House. Jarrett remains in her post at the White House, though Axelrod and Emanuel have both returned to Chicago -- Emanuel as the city's mayor, and Axelrod as chair of a politics institute at the University of Chicago. Education Secretary Arne Duncan will step down in December, an administration official said Friday, October 2. Katherine Archuleta, director of the Office of Personnel Management, resigned July 10, a day after revealing a data breach of government computers was vastly larger than originally thought. Margaret Hamburg, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, announced February 5 in an email to staff that she was stepping down after six years as commissioner. Jennifer Palmieri, Obama's communications director, left in spring 2015. She now serves as the director of communications for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Dan Pfeiffer, one of Obama's chief strategists and closest advisers, departed from the White House in early March, officials confirmed. Marilyn Tavenner, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' top administrator who was involved in the roll-out of Obamacare, announced in an email to staff that she was resigning at the end of February 2015. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in October 2014 after multiple security breaches involving the President. The firestorm began after an intruder scaled the fence and entered the White House on September 19, 2014. Gen. David Petraeus stepped down as director of the CIA on November 9, 2012, after an FBI investigation confirmed he was having an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. He served the position for a little over a year. Gen. Eric Shinseki resigned in May 2014 after it was revealed that Veterans Affairs administrators had conspired to cover up wait lists that were months long, leaving sick and dying veterans waiting for care. Kathleen Sebelius resigned as secretary of Health and Human Services in April 2014 after months of backlash against her role in the faulty roll-out of Healthcare.gov. Shirley Sherrod, a former official with the Department of Agriculture, was forced to resign from her position in 2010 after a conservative blogger published a video of her questioning whether to help a white man losing his farm since "" so many black people lost their farm land"" before him. When it was discovered that the video was taken out of context, the USDA offered her another job, which she declined. In June 2010, Obama relieved Gen. Stanley McChrystal from his post as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after disparaging comments McChrystal made against the administration in Rolling Stone magazine. Three months after Tareq and Michaele Salahi crashed a state dinner in November 2009, Desiree Rogers stepped down as White House social secretary. Suzanne Barr, a senior Obama administration political appointee and longtime aide to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, resigned September 1, 2012, amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior lodged by at least three Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees. Duncan said he had not made a decision about his next steps besides spending time with his family and added that he expected to find work that involved ""expanding opportunity for children."" ""Over the years that I have known him, and especially in the months we have worked together here, I've come to recognize John as one of the most passionate, courageous, clear-headed leaders in our field,"" Duncan said. Duncan's departure means Agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack will be the sole remaining Cabinet-level secretary who has been with Obama since 2009. Obama's Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan started in 2009 as his Housing and Urban Development secretary. In the early days of the administration, Duncan and Obama often played pickup basketball on the weekends in Washington â€” Duncan is among the group of close Obama confidantes who participated in the President's Election Day pickup game in 2012 -- though Obama's days on the court have waned in favor of days on the golf course. As education secretary, Duncan pushed reforms to improve the quality of education, including advocating for the controversial Common Core requirements. Many Republicans say the requirements provide unnecessary federal interference in school curriculum. He also implemented the administration's ""Race to the Top"" funding program that has states compete for federal school funding, as well as gone after for-profit colleges for predatory practices.",1.0
