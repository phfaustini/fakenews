Kelly pressed: “But what’s the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs? What are you gonna do?” She noted that many in the Iranian leadership have dismissed Cotton’s letter, while he has irked the Obama administration and even alienated congressional Democrats skeptical of the nuclear talks. “Megyn, if you talk to most Iran experts, they’ll tell you that Iran’s leaders don’t understand our constitutional system,” Cotton answered. “So we need to be crystal clear with the leaders of Iran: Any deal that’s not approved by Congress won’t be accepted by Congress,” he later said. Kelly continued to emphasize that if Cotton is so keen on congressional review, offending Democrats in Congress may not be the optimal way to go about the matter. For his part, Cotton asserted that he wants Democrats to join his effort, effectively torpedoing diplomacy and reprimanding their president. Good luck with that.",1.0
