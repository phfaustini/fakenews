John Kasich may have put himself in position to make a mark when New Hampshire votes next month.    In our weekly poll of 30 political experts — we ask who is strongest in the GOP field each week —  Kasich notched sixth place this week, his highest standing in the 21 weeks we have been running the survey.    Now, it's not first place — that's still Trump. But Kasich's upward movement reflects some thought that he could score second place in the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary. That would plant him firmly in the national headlines and give his campaign fresh life.    ""This week Kasich feels like a 'positive alternative' possibility in NH, amid all the negativity between (Jeb) Bush, (Chris) Christie, and (Marco) Rubio,"" said University of New Hampshire professor Dante Scala. Polls in the state have consistently shown Kasich among a cluster of candidates vying for second place behind Trump, and over the weekend he picked up endorsements from three newspapers in the state.    Kasich also benefits from other candidates — namely Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson — dropping out of the top tier over the past several weeks.    ""The conventional wisdom is that it's either Trump or Cruz.  However, surprises occur when actual people start to vote,"" warned former Democratic congressman Dan Maffei.    Pollster Peter Fenn added, ""The knives are out between Trump and Cruz. The question is: does this give a Rubio, Christie, Kasich or Bush a chance to come up the side and emerge as an alternative?""    Former Republican party official Frank Donatelli agreed, ""Trump, Cruz and Rubio have most potential for the long run,"" Donatelli said. ""There may be one more ticket available if Bush, Christie or Kasich can finish first or second in New Hampshire. Iowa is most important for Cruz as he is lagging in New Hampshire.""    On other odd item worth noting this week: Rand Paul held his spot in eighth place despite being relegated to the happy hour debate that he refused to attend. Paul turned his relegation into a positive by launching a social media storm during the debate that garnered a lot of attention. He was among the top five candidates in growth of Twitter followers during the debate for the first time despite not being on stage.
