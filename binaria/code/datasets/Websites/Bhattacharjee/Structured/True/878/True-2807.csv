The agreement capitalizes on successes that Kurdish forces have had in pushing Islamic State fighters out of the region but stops short of creating a formal no-fly zone that the Turks have long requested, said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to discuss the agreement publicly.    The move follows Turkey's  announcement last week that it will allow U.S. aircraft striking Islamic State targets in Syria to use the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, something the U.S. has long sought because the base is close to the militants' movements. Turkey said its aircraft would join the air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria.    Turkey, a member of NATO, also called for ""consultations"" with the alliance after militant attacks on border posts in Turkey. NATO said it will hold the talks Tuesday.    Turkey's moves come as a boost to the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State. The country had been reluctant to participate in the coalition because of the risk of direct clashes with forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose ouster is a top Turkish priority.    The United States views extermination of the Islamic State as the focus of the coalition air campaign in Syria, and has avoided conflicts with Assad’s forces, who are fighting the Islamic State among many rebel groups.    Ege Seckin, an analyst at IHS Country Risk, said the U.S. is reluctant to establish a no-fly zone along the Turkish-Syrian border because it would require an extensive military effort to counter Syrian air defenses and risks bringing the U.S. into direct conflict with the Assad regime.    In a speech on Sunday, Assad expressed confidence that his government would prevail over rebel forces, but acknowledged his military faced manpower shortages and had lost terrain to rebels during a civil war that is now in its fifth year.    Turkey's newly active role also complicates its relationship with the Kurds, who have fought for an independent state inside Turkey's borders for years. Kurds in Syria are among the most effective ground fighters against Islamic State militants, and an expansion of Turkey’s role in Syria could pose a threat to those Kurdish forces.    Over the weekend Turkish aircraft struck a Kurdish camp in northern Iraq that Turkey considers home to a Kurdish terrorist group. The attack could end a long truce between the government and those Kurdish forces.    Turkey's fear is that Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq may unite to press anew for an independent state.",1.0
