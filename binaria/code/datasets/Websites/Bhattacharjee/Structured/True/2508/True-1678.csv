He has also suggested the American people should deliver a “spanking” to Hillary Clinton.    Now, he is prescribing the same discipline for a protester who interrupted him during a rally in Indiana on Sunday.    “Apparently there’s a young man who’s having some problems,” Cruz said as the man yelled: “You suck!”    “Thank you, son,” Cruz replied, before adding that he believes “children should actually speak with respect.”    “Imagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that years ago,” he said. “You know, in my household, when a child behaves that way, they get a spanking.”    The exchange comes as Cruz and Trump are stumping for every last vote heading into to the Republican primary in Indiana on Tuesday.
