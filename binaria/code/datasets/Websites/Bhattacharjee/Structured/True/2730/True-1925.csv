Reuters reported early Thursday that the errors on form 990s includeÂ under-reporting or over-reporting by millions of dollars the amounts donated by foreign governments, as well as not disclosing the donations as separate from total revenue. Reuters also reported that officials may audit other returns filed by the Clinton Foundation as far back as 15 years ago in the event of more errors being found.    The report will likely add a new layer of scrutiny to the foundation, which has been criticized by Republicans and ethics experts for its ongoing ties to several foreign governments during the early stages of Hillary Clinton's run for the 2016 Democratic nomination.    According to Reuters, the discrepancies are not evidence of wrongdoing in and of themselves, but they do undermine the 990s purpose of holding charities accountable for their funding and expenditures.    For example, between 2010 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation claimed on tax forms that it had not received any money from either the U.S. or foreign governments. In fact, several foreign governments gave the foundation tens of millions of dollars, which was noted on the foundation's updating donor list.    In addition, Reuters reports the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) will re-file its Form 990s for 2012 and 2013 after failing to note government grants in a separate section from total revenue. CHAI had previously re-filed returns from 2010 and 2011 for over-reporting the amount received in government grants by over $100 million.    Hillary Clinton resigned from the Clinton Foundation's board earlier this month ahead of announcing her presidential candidacy, though her husband and daughter both remain directors.
