The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.    This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta â€” ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""    Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January.    If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said.    Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting.    ""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said. ""If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.""",1.0
