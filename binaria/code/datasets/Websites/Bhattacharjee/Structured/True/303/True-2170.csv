Nine other people, four civilians and five police officers, were taken to local hospitals with gunshot wounds and are in good condition, according to police.    The gunman is in police custody after surrendering just before 5 pm local time, police spokesperson Lt. Catherine Buckley told local reporters. The suspect has been identified as Robert Lewis Dear.    The University of Colorado police officer who was killed, Garrett Swasey, 44, was described by family and friends as a loving father of two young children and a devoted co-pastor at his local church.    The incident began at the Planned Parenthood Colorado Springs Westside Health Center just before noon Mountain Time. The gunman exchanged fire with police officers for hours before he was apprehended, and police worked to evacuate people still inside.    Police described the suspect as a stocky, bearded white male wearing a trench coat. He was reportedly armed with a ""long gun."" Reporters have tweeted photographs of the suspect allegedly being taken into custody.    The call to the police originated from the address of the Planned Parenthood clinic, although the motives of the shooter are still unclear.    ""We're not sure what the connection is to Planned Parenthood, but that was the initial address we were given for the service,"" Buckley said.    The FBI warned of threats to reproductive health facilities this past September, in the wake of graphic sting videos that purported to show Planned Parenthood selling fetal body parts for profit. There have been at least four cases of arson perpetrated against Planned Parenthood clinics this year alone.    Planned Parenthood released the following statement on the shooting:    Colorado Springs is about one hour south of Denver.
