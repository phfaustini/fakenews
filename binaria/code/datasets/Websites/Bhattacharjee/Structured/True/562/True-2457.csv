The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders — farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago — for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders.    This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914.    But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.    And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders.    ""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement.    State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.
