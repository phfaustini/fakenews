The condition and location of al-Baghdadi were not known, the military said. It did not say when the strike occurred.    The military statement said al-Baghdadi, 44, had been heading to Karabla, near the Syrian border, to attend a meeting with ISIL commanders, Al Arabiya and other media outlets reported.    ""The location of the meeting was also bombed and many of the group's leaders were killed and wounded,"" the statement said.    Iran's Fars news agency said several Arabic-language media outlets in Iraq have quoted ""informed military sources"" as saying al-Baghdadi had been killed and that no one in the convoy survived the attack. Reuters, however, cited hospital officials and Karabla residents as saying al-Baghdadi was not among the dead.    Also Sunday, the Combined Joint Task Force that coordinates the international effort against the Islamic State said it had staged 24 airstrikes on ISIL in Syria and Iraq on Saturday. The strikes conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve ""further limits the group's ability to project terror and conduct operations,"" the task force said in a statement.    The Islamic State has taken control of a large swath of Iraq and Syria in brutal fighting. Dominated by Sunni Arabs from Syria and Iraq, the group claims religious, political and military authority over Muslims worldwide as it attempts to build a state ruled by strict Sharia law.    The U.S. designated Baghdadi a terrorist four years ago, authorizing a $10 million reward for information leading to his death or capture.  There have been reports in the past that al-Baghdadi had been attacked or even killed, including last November, but he reportedly retains his iron grip on ISIL. The Islamic State's No. 2 leader, Ahmad al-Hayali, reportedly was killed by a U.S. airstrike in August, U.S. officials have said. Al-Hayali, also known as Hajji Mutazz, was killed in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.    The National Security Council said Mutazz, al-Baghdadi's deputy, ""was a primary coordinator for moving large amounts of weapons, explosives, vehicles and people between Iraq and Syria.""    Al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed ""caliph"" of the Islamic State, made news in the U.S. in August when the family of  Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who died in February while being held by the Islamic State, claimed their daughter had been repeatedly raped by the ISIL leader.    Mueller, 26, from Prescott, Ariz., was taken captive in Syria in August 2013 while leaving a Spanish Doctors without Borders hospital in Aleppo.    Al-Baghdadi brought her to live at the home of Abu Sayyaf, a Tunisian in charge of oil and gas revenue for the group, counterterrorism officials said. The details of Mueller's treatment were initially reported by several Yazidi girls who were held at the house, including a 14-year-old and her sister who managed to escape in August 2014. The sisters' version has been corroborated by U.S. officials.    According to the accounts by the Yazidi girls, many Yazidi women passed through the Sayyaf house on the way to being given as ""presents"" to Islamic State fighters. They said rape was a ""reward"" for military victories. The Yazidis are an ancient religious sect, based mostly in Iraq, that has faced savage treatment from ISIL.",1.0
