The billionaire is heading to Capitol Hill Thursday to try and unify the party after a bruising primary election.                    House Republicans are urging the Speaker get behind their party's presumptive nominee. But Ryan, who has been reluctant to support Trump, says he wants to make sure it's done right.           ""Look, I said this the other day: To pretend we are unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary, which just ended like a week ago, to pretend to unify without actually unifying, then we go into the fall with half strength,"" the Wisconsin lawmaker warned.           The meeting comes in the backdrop of ongoing questions over Trump's refusal to release his tax returns.    ""You don't learn much from tax returns, but I would love to give the tax returns,"" the real estate mogul said.           Now Trump says he won't release them until after an IRS audit is done, which may not be until after the election.  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has pounced on that.           ""My husband and I have released 33 years of tax returns. So you gotta ask yourself why doesn't he want to release them?"" she said.           On the subject of taxes, Politico reports Trump has brought in well-known conservative economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore to help him rewrite his initial tax plan.    It's a plan one group said could tack on an additional $10 trillion to $12 trillion onto America's already exploding national debt, and help the economy grow more.           ""The thing I'm going to do is to make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks because they have been absolutely shunned,"" Trump said. ""The other thing is that I'm going to fight very hard for business.""           Trump is also considering tapping former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to a head a commission on radical Islam.            The billionaire told Fox News he may set up the commission to study his immigration policies, including calls for a temporary ban on Muslims coming to America.           But more than a week after officially becoming his party's presumptive nominee, many in the GOP are still split over Trump's conservative credentials.    Meanwhile, although many have questioned whether he can actually beat Clinton in November, a new Reuters poll has him in a dead heat with the former state secretary, with Clinton at 41 percent, Trump at 40 percent and 19 percent undecided.",1.0
