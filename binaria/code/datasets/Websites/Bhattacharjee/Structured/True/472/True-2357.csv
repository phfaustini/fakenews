So far, this presidential soap opera has clearly been entertaining and surprising.    The latest turn is a new CBS/New York Times national poll that shows retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson overtaking Donald Trump as the GOP frontrunner  a development that has the billionaire scratching his head.    ""Trump losing in polls to Carson. Carson? I don't think Carson is going to negotiate really well with China folks in all fairness, okay? I don't think so and I like him. I don't think so,"" Trump remarked at a recent rally.    Expect some Trump jabs Wednesday night. As for Carson, the doctor told CBN News he's hoping voters will see what he represents.    ""I hope they will look at my life, look at the entirety of my life and see that it has been dedicated to the uplifting of people by leading a life that's not full of scandal, and adhering to the values and principles of our Judeo-Christian foundation,"" he said.    Carson's not the only candidate who is relying on faith to help his case. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, believes he will eventually move higher in the polls.    ""I'm the only one on that stage that has a record of standing up to Washington over and over again, of defending the Constitution, of defending liberty, defending religious liberty, and I think that's why we're seeing such incredible enthusiasm among the grassroots,"" Cruz declared.    Cruz, Carson, Trump and others want to strike gold with the key evangelical voting bloc. While this debate could begin to show movement, political strategist Ralph Reed doesn't expect any tidal waves.    ""This idea that there's going to be a coalescing behind one candidate, that's a myth. That's not going to happen. The evangelical community is very vibrant. It's not monolithic and it doesn't march to a single drummer and it's not easy to command,"" Reed explained.    Wednesday night's debate will focus mostly on the economy. That will give candidates like Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a chance to tout their economic records.    Bush will take the opportunity to lay out his recently announced entitlement reform plan, a subject he spoke about at Regent University.         ""My belief is that once you reach 67, or 66 now, your payroll tax as an employee  you should keep it because that's the way you're going to save money more directly and be able to live a life of independence,"" Bush told the crowd.    It's just one of the topics on tap for what is expected to be yet another night of presidential must see TV.",1.0
