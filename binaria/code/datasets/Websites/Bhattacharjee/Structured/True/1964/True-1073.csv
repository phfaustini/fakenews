""It's dead on arrival,"" said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).    Obama's plan, which includes calls for new early-education programs and free community college tuition, among other things, would require new tax revenue from the wealthy Americans and large corporations to fund the initiatives.

Addressing reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast earlier Monday, Club for Growth president David McIntosh said: ""I think the president's proposal for essentially massive tax increases on corporate America is a nonstarter.""    Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are expected to unveil their own budget plans in the coming weeks.
