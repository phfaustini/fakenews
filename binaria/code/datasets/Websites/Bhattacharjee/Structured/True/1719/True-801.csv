""And my answer is when there are nine,"" she said, as if the question even needed to be asked.    Ginsburg also spoke about the difficulties she faced attaining a job in the legal field.    ""In those days, in the Southern District, most judges wouldn’t hire women. In the U.S. attorney’s office, women were strictly forbidden in the Criminal Division. There was one woman in the Civil Division,"" she said.    ""And the excuse for not hiring women in the Criminal Division was they have to deal with all these tough types, and women aren’t up to that. And I was amazed,"" she added. ""I said, have you seen the lawyers at legal aid who are representing these tough types? They’re all women.""    In what is sure to further her ""Notorious RBG"" status, the justice later also delivered this gem of a quote: ""If I had any talent in the world, any talent that God could give me, I would be a great diva.""",1.0
