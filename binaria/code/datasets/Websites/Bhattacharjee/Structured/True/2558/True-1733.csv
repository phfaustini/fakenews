Boehner (R-Ohio) for another term as speaker.    So far, the list of defectors is up to nine. At least two of them have offered themselves as alternatives.    To be elected speaker, Boehner must win a majority of all members -- Democrat, Republican or otherwise -- who cast votes. When the new Congress is sworn in Tuesday, there will be 246 Republicans (since Michael Grimm is resigning) and 188 Democrats for a total of 434 members. If some members don't cast votes, the threshold for clinching a win will be lowered.    Boehner's office appears confident he will win. But the expanding list threatens to inject some drama into the proceedings.    ""Rep. Boehner was selected as the House Republican Conference's choice for Speaker in November, and he expects to be elected by the whole House next week,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in an e-mail Sunday.    In 2013, Boehner faced 12 Republican defectors, several of whom are opposing him again.    Here's a list of the nine Republicans who have come out against Boehner so far. We'll update it as it changes:    Rep.-elect Dave Brat (Va.) (op-ed)     Rep. Jim Bridenstine (Okla.) (statement)     Rep. Louie Gohmert (Tex.) (statement; also offered himself as speaker candidate)     Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.) (statement)     Rep. Walter Jones (N.C.) (remarks)     Rep. Steve King (Iowa) (Tweet)     Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.) (statement)     Rep. Marlin Stutzman (Ind.) (statement)     Rep. Ted Yoho (Fla.) (statement; also offered himself as a candidate for speaker)",1.0
