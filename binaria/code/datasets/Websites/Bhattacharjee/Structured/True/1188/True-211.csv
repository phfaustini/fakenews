Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he plans to meet Tuesday night with Hillary Clinton about her agenda as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and will make other decisions about the future of his campaign after that.    “I simply want to get a sense of what kind of platform she will be supporting, whether she will be vigorous in standing up for working families and the middle class, moving aggressively in climate change, health care for all, making public colleges and universities tuition-free,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And after we have that kind of discussion, and after we can determine whether or not we are going to have a strong and progressive platform, I will be able to make other decisions.”    Sanders told host Chuck Todd that he will have more than 1,900 delegates at the convention and that he needs to determine “what kind of agenda there will be if Secretary Clinton gets elected, if she wins the election.”    During a separate TV appearance Sunday, Sanders said he thinks it is “very unlikely” that Clinton would pick him as her running mate.    Asked about the prospect of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) filling that slot, Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” that he is a “great admirer” of Warren.    When asked whether Clinton is capable of leading a “political revolution” — a phrase that has motivated Sanders’s campaign — Sanders said she was not, but that she could implement some solid progressive policies.    “Will she got as far as I would like her to go? No, she won’t,” Sanders said.    “Meet the Press” and “This Week” were two of three morning talk shows on which Sanders appeared Sunday. He was also interviewed by CBS's ""Face the Nation.""    [How Bernie Sanders’s day in Washington got eclipsed by Democratic unity]    The interviews are Sanders’s first since he met with President Obama on Thursday, the same day that Obama, Vice President Biden and Warren endorsed Clinton.    The senator from Vermont said Thursday that he plans to compete in the final Democratic primary of the year, Tuesday in the District, making good on his pledge to stay in the race until all voters have had a chance to weigh in on the nomination.    Sanders previously vowed to stay in the race until the Democratic convention in Philadelphia next month, in a last-ditch attempt to win the nomination by flipping the allegiances of hundreds of superdelegates who’ve previously announced their support for Clinton, the party’s presumptive nominee.    He made no mention of that strategy during his interviews on Sunday morning.    Later Sunday, Sanders met at his home in Burlington, Vt., with a few dozen leading supporters. Speaking to the press, he did not say he was exiting the race, however.    ""Are we going to take our campaign for transforming Democratic Party into the convention? Absolutely,"" he told reporters. He also said he is ""very good at arithmetic.""    As of Sunday, Clinton had accumulated 2,784 delegates, including superdelegates, exceeding the amount needed to clinch the nomination by more than 400, according to the latest Associated Press tally, which put Sanders’s total at 1,877.    To have a shot at wresting the nomination from Clinton, Sanders would need to flip the allegiances at least 400 of the 581 superdelegates who have announced their support for Clinton — about 70 percent of them.",1.0
