Thursday night she walked on stage at the 2016 convention as the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party.    ""Stronger together"" was the overwhelming theme Thursday evening as Clinton took the stage, with an early shout-out to Bernie Sanders supporters, some of whom protested her nomination with glow in the dark shirts.    Clinton's main efforts focused on differentiating herself from rival Donald Trump, as well as focusing on the ""steady leadership"" she would provide on foreign policy and the economy.    Largely absent from her speech: mentions of faith, religious liberty and abortion. She did get in a dig at Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, saying ""we will not ban a religion.""    She also referenced her Methodist faith, telling of her mother's admonition to ""do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.""    Aside from Clinton making history as the first female presidential nominee from a major U.S. political party, her daughter Chelsea is also making history, having both of her parents run as the presidential candidate for their party.    ""I am here as a proud American, a proud Democrat, a proud mother, and tonight in particular a very, very proud daughter,"" Chelsea Clinton said in her speech introducing her mother.    ""I am so grateful to be her daughter, she makes me proud every single day,"" Clinton said.    Although Hillary Clinton won the nomination, the big question surrounding her historic night was would she be able to garner the attention and popularity she needs in order for Democrats to get behind her. She was quick to praise President Barack Obama whose legacy she hopes to build on.    ""America is stronger because of Obama's leadership,"" Clinton said.    In an attempt at party unity she also pointedly affirmed her former opponent Bernie Sanders in the first few minutes of her speech, hoping to appease his supporters.    Her focus later turned to rival Donald Trump as she alternately fired away at his campaign and cast a vision for her own.    ""Don't let anyone tell you our country is weak. We are not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes--we do,"" Clinton said.    She continued to tell the audience to never believe someone who says he can fix the country on his own, referring to Trump.    ""He is forgetting every last one of us,"" Clinton said.    She went on to use her campaign slogan saying, ""We can fix it together,"" and referenced her book, It takes a Village.    ""'Stronger together' is not just a slogan for our campaign, but a guiding principle,"" she said.    Clinton made multiple promises throughout the nearly one-hour speech, from her plan to support ""local forces"" to take out ISIS to creating ""more good jobs with rising wages"" in the United States.    She also promised to work with Sen. Bernie Sanders on education.    ""Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt-free for all. We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt,""Â  she said.    Clinton assured her audience that she'll provide the necessary leadership in foreign policy and attacked Trump's ability to handle complicated foreign affairs.    ""Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,"" she said. ""A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.""    Clinton said the United States will prevail over ISIS, promising to strike its sanctuaries from the air, support local forces on the ground and increase intelligence.    Earlier on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey warned of the great threat the U.S. faces with the growing terrorist organization.    Clinton ended the night on a note of promise for the future, telling Americans, ""We are stronger together.""",1.0
