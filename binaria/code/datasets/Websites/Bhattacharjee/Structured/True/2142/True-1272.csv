Clinton leads Trump, 47 to 43 percent, among likely voters in the poll released early Sunday. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson has 5 percent and the Green Party’s Jill Stein has 2 percent.    Clinton maintains a 4-point lead over Trump, 50 to 46 percent, in the two-way race.    Clinton led Trump by 2 points in a four-way race, 46 to 44 percent, in the same poll earlier. The new poll was conducted following the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump makes lewd comments about women.    The poll of 740 likely voters, conducted Oct. 10-13, has a 4-percentage-point margin of error.    Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they believe that the Republican presidential nominee likely made unwanted sexual advances. Most also said his apology was insincere.    More than half of all respondents, 64 percent, said the tape won’t make a difference in their votes.",1.0
