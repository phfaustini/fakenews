Her Republican opponent Donald Trump took shots at her over the issue Thursday while speaking in Cleveland.    ""Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program among many other extremely sensitive matters. This is yet more evidence that Clinton is unfit to be your commander in chief,"" the business mogul charged.    Clinton has claimed that she didn't send or receive any email with classified marking, but a new report from Fox News says that a Clinton email had classified markings on virtually every paragraph.    Meanwhile, Clinton talked freely about her faith to the National Baptist Convention, the oldest African-American Baptist denomination.    ""Sometimes people ask me, are you a praying person? And I tell them, 'If I wasn't one before, one week living in the White House or on the campaign trail would've turned me into a praying person,"" she said in Kansas City, Missouri, Thursday,    Clinton's lead over Trump has been dropping in the polls in recent days. But the race will, as always, come down to the Electoral College, especially in the swing states -- and the polls show the race getting tighter in four of the key states.    In a new Quinnipiac poll that also includes the two independent candidates, Trump has a slight lead in Ohio, but is tied with Clinton in Florida. The former secretary of state, however, holds slim leads in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.    While Clinton still appears to be ahead in the Electoral College, the campaign is far from over.    Both candidates are likely to focus the last two months of the campaign on the battleground states, where the race will almost certainly be decided.",1.0
