And, according to Politico, the pressure is already on for Bush to do the same.    Though details of Romney’s endorsement are “still being worked out” as of this morning, sources tell The Huffington Post that Romney has been “eager to provide his backing to Rubio for days” but hesitated out of respect for Bush. His endorsement could come before Tuesday’s G.O.P. caucuses in Nevada, which dedicated Romneyists will recall were twice won by Romney himself.    For his part, though, Rubio doesn’t believe the Romney endorsement is coming anytime soon. “Well, that report is false,” he told CNN of the Romney rumors on Sunday. “I have no reason to believe that he’s anywhere near endorsing anyone. We would love to have his endorsement, but there’s nothing forthcoming. I don’t know where those reports are coming from, but they’re false.”    Should Romney indeed endorse Rubio, his backing would make sense, as he and Rubio have a history: Rubio once made Romney’s VP shortlist, and Rubio once chilled at Romney’s New Hampshire vacation home on the Fourth of July, which is the most Republican sentence that has ever been written. Romney’s seal of approval is key in that it suggests establishment Republican leaders are finally ready to “coalesce” around Rubio, rallying together to defeat the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump’s current front-running status.    On the Jeb-endorsing-Rubio front, things are less clear-cut. The two fellow Floridians spent months savaging each other on the campaign trail, and Bush dropped out of the race because Rubio essentially destroyed him in South Carolina. Bush needs a few days to cool off, call his mom, and secure his invite to Romney’s New Hampshire vacation home before he’s ready to address the Florida politicos who are chomping at the bit to know whether he’ll “endorse the man he long called a friend” in public but apparently lambastes in private—sometimes in “strikingly personal overtones,” according to Politico. If Bush decides not to endorse Rubio, it will mark a significant political rift in Florida—a state where, it should be mentioned, Trump remains far ahead in the polls.    The clock is ticking for both possible endorsements: Floridians are already voting by absentee ballot for the March 15 primary, which means somebody needs to tell them who the hell to vote for before it’s too late and Trump wins the nomination. “No one knows what’s going to happen,” an anonymous Florida House Republican told Politico. “There are a lot of hard feelings. We’ll have to wait till the dust settles. Make that, the dirt. Once the dirt settles.”",1.0
