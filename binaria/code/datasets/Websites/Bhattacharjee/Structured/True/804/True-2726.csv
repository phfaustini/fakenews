She is slated to wrap up her term as DNC chair in January 2017 and speculation has swirled around a possible run by the congresswoman.    Wasserman Schultz said she has ""gotten tremendous encouragement from constituents"" in her district, Floridians and donors, but ultimately decided against a Senate run.    Former Gov. Charlie Crist, another Florida Democrat, also said this week that he would not seek the seat currently held by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is up for reelection in 2016.

Wasserman Schultz's announcement opens a wider path for two of her Democratic colleagues in Florida's congressional delegation who are considering a Senate run: Reps. Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson.
