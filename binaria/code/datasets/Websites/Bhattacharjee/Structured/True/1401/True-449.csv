John McCain's war record.    And Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America:    As we reported previously, Trump, attending a Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday, lashed out at the Arizona Republican and former GOP presidential nominee, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam after being shot down in 1967.    ""He was a war hero because he was captured,"" Trump said. ""I like people who weren't captured.""    Fellow candidates, including former Govs. Jeb Bush and Rick Perry and Sen. Marco Rubio, have fired back at Trump, with Rubio saying on CNN Sunday that the remarks were a ""disqualifier"" for the Republican nomination.    Asked on ABC's This Week if he owed McCain an apology, Trump answered: ""No, not at all.""    ""John McCain has failed,"" he said, citing the Arizona senator's record on veterans' issues. ""I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years, with all talk, no action. ... Nothing gets done.""
