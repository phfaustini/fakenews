CBN’s Jennifer Wishon and economist Steve Moore addressed these issues and more on The 700 Club.    President-elect Donald Trump met with President Barack Obama at the White House Thursday in what turned out to be a cordial first step in the transfer of power.    “We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy,” the president told reporters following the 90-minute meeting, adding that it's important for the country to come together to face the challenges ahead.    Trump, for his part, said he looks forward to being with the president ""many, many more times.""    CBN's David Brody and Jenna Browder talk to protesters outside the White House Thursday. (Audio begins at 1:30)    The meeting came as thousands of anti-Trump protestors hit the streets Wednesday, from New York to Philadelphia to Chicago and Los Angeles, to express their anger over Trump's surprising victory.    One protestor expressed the shock and disbelief of many Clinton supporters when she said, ""Something horrific and unbelievable has happened.""    But Trump promised to be a president for all Americans.    ""To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people,"" Trump said in his victory speech Wednesday morning.    Obama also called for Americans to come together, saying, ""It is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country.""    Although many world leaders also expressed support for Trump, Europeans who watched the election closely and expected a certain Clinton victory were still trying to come to grips with the results.  French President Francois Hollande said Trump's victory ""opens a period of uncertainty.""    Much more certain is Trump's agenda for his first 100 days.  A top priority is to repeal and replace Obamacare.    ""Believe me, we'll get rid of that,"" Trump warned when he was on the campaign trail. ""I've been saying it for years.""                                                          Trump has also promised middle class families a 35 percent tax cut, although the Tax Foundation, which has reviewed the plan, said it would actually cut taxes for several income levels.                                              Trump has also vowed to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and to make it a lot tougher for persons from terror-related countries to enter the U.S., saying, ""Radical Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant.""                                                          The president-elect is also eager to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court, which has been vacant since Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, with a conservative justice -- and he could get more chances to appoint justices.    Wall Street quickly adjusted to the idea of a Trump presidency.  After an initial sell-off, stocks posted strong gains.    Meanwhile, President-elect Trump has a lot on his plate, and a lot to talk about when he meets with President Obama.",1.0
