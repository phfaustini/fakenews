In a Wednesday interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, who named the former first lady the ""Most Fascinating Person of 2013,"" Clinton said she hadn't yet made up her mind on a presidential run. She assured Walters her announcement would come soon.    ""Obviously, I will look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year,"" Clinton said.    Pundits have discussed a Clinton run since she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008. Pollsters have weighed her chances of winning the 2016 nomination and dedicated supporters have laid the foundation for her campaign in a quickly growing super PAC called ""Ready for Hillary."" But Clinton told Walters an official announcement was premature.    ""It's such a difficult decision, and it's one that I'm not going to rush into ... and I don't think we should be looking at the next election,"" Clinton said. ""I think we should be looking at the work that we have today. Our unemployment rate is too high. We have people getting kicked off food stamps who are in terrible economic straits. Small business is not getting credit, I could go on and on, so I think we ought to pay attention to what's happening right now.""    Clinton told Walters that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has said he wants her ""to do what I think is right,"" prompting Walters to ask what America would call him if she were to win.    CORRECTION: This article originally said Clinton lost the Democratic nomination to Obama in 2012. She lost in 2008.",1.0
