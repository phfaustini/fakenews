In doing so, Obama put his stamp on the recommendations of a multi-agency federal working group that endorsed a ban on sales of some military equipment and providing more training, supervision and oversight of others.    ""We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like they're an occupying force, as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them,"" Obama said in a speech in Camden, N.J. Monday. He said military equipment can ""alienate and intimidate local residents and may send the wrong message.""    In Camden, Obama highlighted a wide range of administration initiatives to fight crime, improve police-community relations and improve transparency in policing. They include a White House data initiative to encourage local police departments to release more information about arrests and uses of force by police; guidelines for police use of body-worn cameras; and federal grants to help implement community policing strategies.    But the changes to federal policies on the use of military equipment for police received most of the attention, following the use of armored trucks, riot gear, tear gas and assault rifles by police last year in Ferguson, Mo., where days of unrest followed the police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old man.    Banned will be tracked armored vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers, camouflage uniforms, and large-caliber weapons and ammunition.    ""So we're going to prohibit some equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments,"" Obama said. ""There's other equipment that may be needed in certain cases, but only with proper training.""    That equipment will be placed on a ""controlled equipment list"" that includes aircraft, wheeled tactical vehicles, mobile command-and-control units, battering rams and riot gear.    To have access to that equipment, police departments must meet national policing standards, track their use and receive approval from the federal government before selling or transferring them.    The ban on prohibited items takes effect immediately, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said. The other recommendations will go into effect Oct. 1, allowing the administration to write more specific rules.    Although those rules haven't been drafted, the White House highlighted one policy by the University of Texas System police that prohibits the use of military vehicles in response to ""exercises of the First Amendment right to free speech"" or as a part of ""any public demonstration or display of police resources.""    To be eligible to purchase that equipment, agencies must adopt ""robust and specific written policies and protocols"" covering not just the use of the federal equipment, but their policing practices in general. Agencies that violate those rules would be barred from future equipment purchases for at least 60 days and, in some cases, be referred to the Justice Department for a civil rights investigation.    Through an executive order in January, Obama asked for federal departments to consult with police and civil rights groups to come up with recommendations on police use of military equipment. Obama ratified those executive actions Monday.    But Congress is also considering legislation. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who is sponsoring one of those bills, called the president's action a step in the right direction and an acknowledgment ""that this federal equipment and funding saves lives, but that these programs are in need of reform ""    In a 50-page report released Monday, the working group noted that many police departments increasingly rely on the federal government for equipment as local budgets are strained. ""Yet, in some neighborhoods and communities, incidents of misuse, overuse, and inappropriate use of controlled equipment occur, and the resulting strain placed on the community and its relationship with law enforcement is severe,"" the report said.",1.0
