Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.    While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.    “I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.    Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.    “I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”    Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”    Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.",1.0
