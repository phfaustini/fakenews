This weekend was a perfect example of two candidates who live in their own reality.    Hillary Clinton in the debate Saturday night argued that Donald Trump was “becoming ISIS’s best recruiter.” She insisted, “They are going to people, showing them videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.” There is no such video, and her statement has been rated “false” by fact checkers. Nevertheless, her campaign team insists this is so.    Not to be outmatched in the fantasy department, Trump is still insisting thousands of Muslims were celebrating 9/11 in New Jersey. This too is false, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has repeatedly said it did not happen.    Scarily, these candidates’ larger worldviews are at odds with reality as well. Trump basks in the compliments of Russian President Putin and — incredibly — claims there is no evidence suggesting Putin killed journalists. (“But, in all fairness to Putin, you’re saying he killed people. I haven’t seen that. I don’t know that he has.”) Apparently he will buy into the notion that thousands of Muslims were celebrating 9/11 but insists on Putin’s fingerprints on the gun before acknowledging Putin’s hand in the deaths of scores of journalists. Someone should tell Trump that Putin’s regime also kills businessmen’s lawyers.    Trump’s world is not so different from the far-left world in which the United States has been the troublemaker (“Well, take a look at — take a look at — excuse me, take a look at the rampage all over the place“) and civil rights atrocities in dictatorial regimes around the globe are no big deal.    Then there is Hillary Clinton’s worldview, in which the Obama-Clinton foreign policy is a success. She’s insisted the Russian “reset” worked. In Saturday’s debate, she proclaimed, “We now finally are where we need to be. We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS which is a danger to us as well as the region, and we finally have a U.N. Security Council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.” In its own way, this is as stunning as Trump’s non-facts. The president’s military advisers and secretary of defense acknowledge that the Islamic State is not contained. Innocents have been slaughtered in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Russia and Iran are backing Bashar al-Assad. And the administration has stopped saying Assad must go. The bloody civil war rages on. Our Sunni Arab allies do not trust us. We have helped revive the Iranian economy and in turn allowed Iran to redouble its support for Assad, Hezbollah and others. If she thinks a U.N. resolution is going to make things better, she truly is in her own universe. Yes, siree, we are right where we want to be.    We can only hope one or both parties finds someone to nominate grounded in reality. For seven years we have had a president who imagines the world is as he wishes it to be, who thought (among other things): The world would be improved if the United States receded, we shouldn’t rock the boat by backing the Green Revolution;  there was a fatwa against nukes in Iran; and without the United States as the dominant presence the Middle East, we would do just fine. Picking someone equally if not more delusional than President Obama will have serious implications for the United States and the world.",1.0
