Ted Cruz argued Saturday that Democrats have become so extreme and ""intolerant"" of religious views that ""there is no room for Christians in today's Democratic Party.""    ""There is a liberal fascism that is dedicated to going after believing Christians who follow the biblical teaching on marriage,"" the Texas Republican said in his speech before a Christian conservative audience in Waukee, Iowa.    Cruz joined eight other presidential candidates and potential contenders on stage at the Iowa Faith and Freedom summit, where speakers railed against what they see as threats to religious liberty. For his part, Cruz alluded to business that faced pushback for declining to cater to same-sex weddings.    Many of the speakers also pointed to the recent debate over an Indiana religious liberty law that was designed to protect those who objected to participating in same-sex marriage ceremonies. But the law came under fire from critics who said it was discriminatory against same-sex couples, and its language was subsequently tweaked.    As the Supreme Court gets ready to hear oral arguments on whether to overturn same-sex marriage bans in states, Cruz introduced legislation last week that would protect bans in place.    Cruz urged the audience to ""fall on our knees and pray"" ahead of the Supreme Court's final ruling on the issue, which is expected this summer. ""We need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage,"" he said.",1.0
