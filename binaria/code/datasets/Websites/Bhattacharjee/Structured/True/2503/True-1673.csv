""I don't see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently,"" FBI Director James Comey said.           But why was the killer allowed to walk into a gun store and buy firearms despite the fact that he had once been under FBI surveillance for nearly a year?    Witnesses now say that Mateen was a regular at the Pulse nightclub and dated men. Officials say he also scouted Disney World for a possible attack.    Meanwhile, as the investigation continues, the shooting has taken over the presidential campaign.           After President Barack Obama refused to even utter the words 'Muslim' or 'Islamic terrorism' in his statement on the Orlando massacre, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expanded his proposed Muslim ban.    The billionaire says the doors to the United States should be closed to anyone from nations with a track record of Islamic terrorism, regardless of their religion.    ""I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats,"" he vowed.    Trump accused Obama of being willfully ignorant about the issue of Islamic terrorism.    ""There's something is going on,"" he said of the president and Islamic terrorism,           Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at first followed the president's politically correct line.    ""Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror,"" she said.    But her opponent pounced. Trump said Clinton isn't strong enough on America's enemies.    ""Her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world,"" he said.           Clinton finally uttered the words ""radical Islamism"" in an phone interview with CNN, but said she would not ""demonize an entire religion.""    ""We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves,"" she later admitted.    The Democratic response during a raucus session of Congress Monday wasn't on tougher anti-terror laws but gun control legislation. But Republicans stopped it.           While politicians debate what should be done, investigators are still trying to learn more about the man who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in American history.",1.0
