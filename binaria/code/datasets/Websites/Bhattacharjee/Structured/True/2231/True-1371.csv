Scott Walker said Tuesday that he was ""very interested"" in a possible run for president on 2016, hours after he announced the launch of a new political committee.    In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Walker said he was considering a run for the same reason he initially ran for governor of Wisconsin in 2010.    ""[My wife and I] were afraid that our sons were growing up in a state that wasn't as great as the one we grew up in,"" Walker, 47, said."" I have the same worries about this country for my sons today that I had for my state many years ago.""    Walker, who gave a well-received speech to a forum of conservative voters in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, set up the committee “Our American Revival” on Jan. 16. A new website for the so-called 527 organization, which will help him get his message out as he works toward building his political clout, went live Tuesday morning.    ""Our American Revival encompasses the shared values that make our country great,"" Walker said in a written statement. He called for ""limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the Constitution while creating a leaner, more efficient, more effective and more accountable government to the American people.""    Walker echoed that refrain on ""Hannity"" and played up his status as a Washington outsider.    ""I think we need new bold leadership from outside of Washington that's proven to take on the challenges that we face in this country right now,"" Walker said. ""The ideas that are going to transform America aren't coming from people in Washington. They're coming from our state leaders ... I think there's a sense out there, which I heard on Saturday, that people don't just want dynamic speakers. They want people who've got a proven record, who've actually done something, not just talked about it.""    ""If we're going to take [former Secretary of State and presumptive Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton on,"" Walker added,"" we've got to have a name from the future, not one from the past, in an apparent shot at 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.    Walker’s steps are in stride with other prospective candidates, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who earlier this week launched a political action committee.    During his speech Saturday in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-country caucus, Walker drew on his highly publicized battle with unions in his home state and told an emotional story of how he and his family received death threats for speaking out against the groups.    “If you are not afraid to go big and bold, you can actually get results,” he told the crowd.    Following his speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, Walker went west – attending an event in California hosted by the billionaire Koch brothers.",1.0
