The GOP nominee was on his best behavior during his latest campaign stop, managing to stay on topic and never lose his cool despite interruptions by protesters.    Speaking at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump laid out his plans for America's economy.    ""We will make America grow again. I want to jump-start America and it can be done and it won't even be that hard,"" he vowed.    Among his ideas were the following proposals:    Trump also took some time to slam Clinton's economic plans, saying she punished Americans for working and doing business in the United States.    Clinton wasted no time firing back, calling Trump's plans a re-packaging of old Republican ideas.    ""Today in Detroit he's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named. Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve,"" Clinton told supporters at a campaign rally in Kissimmee, Florida. ""They wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. They tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new.""    She said that, unlike Trump, she would be a ""small business president"" and create jobs.    ""If Trump were able to implement what he's proposing, heaven forbid, it would cost three and a half million jobs. He would actually reduce jobs,"" she warned.    Meanwhile, the latest round of national polls show Clinton leading her GOP rival by double digits.    But Trump's hour-long speech on a key issue - the economy - could be another sign that the Republican candidate is ready to begin working with the GOP to get his campaign back on track.",1.0
