Incoming interim party leader Donna Brazile and six other officials said the emails ""do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process.""    It wasn't signed by the outgoing DNC head, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who announced Monday that she will not gavel in her party's national convention.    ""I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,"" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel of Ft. Lauderdale, according to The Associated Press.    In the wake of an email scandal, Wasserman Schultz said Sunday that she will resign her post as chairwoman of the DNC after the Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, said it was ""her decision"" to step down.    Clinton is all set to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president. She will be the first woman ever to rise to such a position.    But that story is taking a backseat to the controversy brewing inside the Democratic Party.    Thousands of leaked emails show a supposedly impartial DNC working to secure the nomination for Clinton, even trying to paint the Jewish Bernie Sanders as an atheist to voters in the South.    The scandal comes as no surprise to Sanders' supporters who see Clinton as too establishment and cozy with Wall Street.    ""I think the Clinton people stole it. The corruption has become more well-known with the WikiLeaks and such,"" claimed one Sanders supporter.    Meanwhile, Clinton has hired Wasserman Schultz to be a part of her campaign, according to Townhall.com. The Democratic presidential candidate sent an email to supporters, announcing Wasserman Schultz would become the ""honorary chair"" of the 50-state program to make sure Democrats win at the polls across the country.    Opponents of the Florida congresswoman heckled her at a breakfast of state delegates Monday, shouting, ""Shame!"" and ""You're ruining our democracy!""    Supporters of Sanders displayed paper signs that said ""E-mails"" on one side and ""Thanks for the 'help' Debbie,"" on the other.    Wasserman Schultz told the crowd during the uproar that ""we have to make sure that we move together in a unified way.""    The Hill.com reports that ""allies"" of Clinton believe Wasserman Schultz should not even stay on as DNC chairwoman during the convention. The news outlet says one ally referred to what happened at the Florida breakfast as a reason.    ""It's causing the distraction no one wanted at the convention,"" one Clinton ally said, according to The Hill.    Wasserman Schultz's resignation after the convention, however, doesn't mean the end of the disunity problems. Liberals unhappy with Clinton's vice presidential pick, Sen. Tim Kaine, are looking to cause a stir.    ""There's talk about walking out of the vice presidential or presidential acceptance speech. There's talk about total silence, remaining seated, turning backs,"" Normon Solomon, with the Bernie Delegates Network, said.    Even with this drama, the reality is Clinton will be the nominee. She then faces the challenge of reaching out to disgruntled progressives, while striking a more moderate tone for the General Election.    ""It has been the Democratic Party's history that once the nominee is established and we know who that's going to be and we rally the troops and folks tend to come inside the tent. Of course, there are those who are not coming in the tent and they were never coming in the tent and that's okay,"" Leah Daughtry, CEO of the DNC, said.    All eyes will be on Sanders to see what he says to delegates Monday evening.    Meanwhile, Kaine will be facing the biggest speech of his career.    Liberals aren't happy he's the vice presidential choice and conservatives think he's too liberal, which leads many Democrats to believe he's just right.    The reality about Kaine is that once people know him, they tend to like him - even if they disagree with him. Â And he's never lost an election.    ""I am so excited. I've known Tim Kaine for many years and so I know his heart. I know his heart and his commitment,"" reflected Alexis Herman, former secretary of labor.    Coming off one of the biggest days of his life Sen. Kaine walked through his Richmond neighborhood with his wife Anne to Saint Elizabeth Catholic Church. It's where the couple has worshipped for three decades.    Inside, Kaine got emotional at times and even sang a solo in the choir. Although he has worked to reduce abortions, he's come under fire for his support of pro-choice policies.    But at the DNC his position is just right.    ""He's a committed Catholic, a social justice Catholic. He takes that very seriously. His work in politics is his outreach,"" Daughtry said.    Several hundred Democrats followed Kaine's example by gathering in Philadelphia at an interfaith service Sunday.    Rev. James Forbes of the Riverside Church says this week Americans will see a vastly different vision for the future.    ""I would wish that the world gets a chance to see two major options - an option that they remember from people who are angry, who are afraid -- versus a group that's willing to risk possibilities that could probably do it together, but that the prospect of our working together is even brighter,"" Forbes told CBN News.    So far, it's been a mixed bag but the week is young.",1.0
