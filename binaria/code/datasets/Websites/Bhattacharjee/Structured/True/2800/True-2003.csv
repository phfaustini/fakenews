This is the second in our series looking at the unique qualifications and arguments for the 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls. Last week we looked at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Today we turn to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).    Like President Obama was, Rubio is a first-term senator with great rhetorical skills. That however is where the comparison ends. The argument for his candidacy can be boiled down to 10 points.    1. Unlike Obama, Rubio has a specific message that is more than “hope and change.” He is a more adept salesman for the reform agenda than, say, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) (“Ryan and Rubio are like-minded legislators who approach problems from a similar ideological perspective. The difference, they say, is that Rubio possesses the political skill to accomplish what Ryan has not: taking conservative reforms outside the halls of Congress and selling them to a national electorate.”)    2. He is unmistakably the face of a new generation of Republicans, perfectly designed to take on the Social Security-eligible Hillary Clinton.    3. Rubio is better able than any other contender to attack Clinton where she is weakest, namely on her foreign-policy record. He understands how and where she and the president failed and can articulate a hard-nosed alternative vision of U.S. leadership. Unlike other freshman senators vying for the nomination, he has consistently been on the right side of tough anti-terrorism measures (e.g., support for the NSA, willing to commit whatever force is needed to defeat the Islamic state). His knowledge of foreign policy issues and ability to outmaneuver opponents of a robust foreign policy was on display at a recent Koch brothers’ event when he slapped down Sen. Rand Paul (R-Fla.).    4. He is no novice in politics. He was elected to the Florida state house in 1999 and to the speakership in 2003. Among other things, he helped lead a property tax overhaul.    5. It will be hard to pass him on the right. He has an 89 percent lifetime conservative rating from Heritage Action and near-perfect ratings from other conservative groups.    6. With the exception of Jeb Bush, he is the only fluent Spanish speaker who can reach the Hispanic audience without a filter and who  can converse directly with Spanish-language media.    7.  He has a compelling immigrant story and the ability to identify with working people. At the 2012 RNC convention, he told the crowd:    My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them. Many nights I heard my father’s keys jingling at the door as he came home after another 16-hour day. Many mornings, I woke up just as my mother got home from the overnight shift at K-Mart When you’re young, the meaning of moments like these escapes you. But now, as my own children get older, I understand it better. My Dad used to tell us: “En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos” “In this country, you will be able to accomplish all the things we never could.” A few years ago during a speech, I noticed a bartender behind a portable bar at the back of the ballroom. I remembered my father who had worked for many years as a banquet bartender. He was grateful for the work he had, but that’s not the life he wanted for us. He stood behind a bar in the back of the room all those years, so one day I could stand behind a podium in the front of a room.    8. While supporting the traditional definition of marriage, he does not sound like a zealot or Constitutional know-nothing. “I wouldn’t agree with [the Supreme Court] ruling, but that would be the law of the land that we would have to follow until it’s somehow reversed — either by a future Supreme Court, or a U.S. constitutional amendment, which I don’t think is realistic or foreseeable.”    9. He is entirely at ease with the mainstream media as well as with conservative outlets, and he is adept at using self-deprecating humor.    10. Compared with other GOP contenders, Rubio tends to do well with women voters.",1.0
