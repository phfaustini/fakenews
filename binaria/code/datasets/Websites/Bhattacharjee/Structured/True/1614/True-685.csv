They were so impressed with his book Gifted Hands — which was required reading for their children during home schooling lessons — that they decided to name their son Carson.    “When I got the chance to shake his hand, I patted my wife’s belly and said this one is named in your honor,” said Bouwsma, a truck driver from Grand Rapids.    Eleven years later, Bouwsma traveled with Carsonto Detroit to witness his son's namesake announce that he was running for president. Six weeks later, Bouwsma contributed $1,000 to Carson’s campaign, his first political contribution..    “I believe Dr. Carson stands for completely airing your views while not trying to shoot at other people in terms of dragging them down,” said the self-described Christian conservative.    Bouwsma’s enthusiasm, from yard signs to the possibility of working on Carson’s campaign, is increasingly being seen around the country, as the retired pediatric neurosurgeon surges to the top tier of the large GOP presidential field.    Carson’s numbers in the polls are rising both nationally and in the critical early states. A recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics showed Carson's favorability ratings at 79%, by far the highest of any of the 17 Republican presidential contenders.    “There’s an overall mood of people willing to take a risk on someone who is outside the system and who could be disruptive to the system. And could he and Donald Trump be any more different?” said J. Ann Selzer, president of the Iowa polling firm that conducted the Iowa poll, about Carson’s surge in the polls. “Part of what Carson has going for him is that he started coming to Iowa last year. People have already gotten a feel for who is and what he stands for.”    Carson has a dedicated cadre of volunteers helping with the campaign and his super PAC and a huge presence on social media with 2.6 million Facebook followers who get daily video updates from the campaign leadership. Followers also get the chance to have three questions answered each evening by the campaign.    “We have a very aggressive approach to Facebook.” said Doug Watts, communications director for the campaign.    So when the campaign had a recent event in Phoenix to talk about border issues, they were able to tap into their social media network and donor list and draw a crowd of 12,000, Watts said. Carson has attracted 2,000 to 3,000 people at recent events in Iowa and Colorado.    “We’re looking at an event in Orange County next week. We drew a 40-mile radius around the event site and came up with 50,000 people who had donated to the campaign,” he said.    Rita Davenport of Boone, Iowa, may not have donated money to Carson’s campaign but she’s putting in three to four hours every night to help out by making phone calls, walking in parades and setting up events for Carson in Iowa.    Even after working her full-time job as an instructor and counselor at Des Moines Area Community College, she’s ready to organize another forum with black ministers for Carson in Des Moines. “I talked with people in the ministry and we’ll be doing more of those types of forums because he’s really the kind of person who wants to keep reaching out,” she said. “Every waking moment that I’m not in my office, I’m trying to do stuff to help get Dr. Carson elected.”    As an African American, Davenport said she’s been aware of Carson for years, calling him a “living legend,” who sparked her interest even more when he challenged the policies of President Obama during a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 while the president sat nearby. It was that “speaking truth to power” that got her pumped about the prospect of a Carson candidacy and it’s an attribute that she continues to see at campaign events in Iowa.    “I see people who are really prayerful and very family friendly at these events,” she said. “And he proves that he can get his point across without yelling and calling people names.”    Indeed, Mary Buerger, 88 of Hillsdale, Mich., said she’s already tired of Donald Trump, who she calls a “foghorn"" who's ""way too off the cuff.""    Buerger is one of more than 275,000 unique donors who have given to Carson’s campaign, pitching in $325 for the retired neurosurgeon, who grew up in poverty on the rough and tumble southwest side of Detroit. The campaign raised $9 million in July and August and $20 million overall since Carson entered the race in May.    While there are things she likes about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Carson remains her focus. When she gets polling information in the mail asking her to rank her top three candidates, she only has one name to share.    “He has a method of speaking which is not confrontational, but he’s very clear in his positions. He doesn’t turn people off with the first few words that he says,” she said. “We’ve gotten to be so very confrontational and so badly divided that we need him.”    It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have political experience. In fact, that’s a plus for Buerger. “He isn’t beholden like the people who have made their mark in government. I think it’s hard for people to have that independence,” she added.    Selzer said policy positions and political experience are not essential for Iowa voters, yet. “The majority of the people are saying, ‘I trust them to figure it out when they get to the White House,’ which says a lot about the mood of the voters,"" she said.",1.0
