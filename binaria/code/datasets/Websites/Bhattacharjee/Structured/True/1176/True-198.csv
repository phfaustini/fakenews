The 79-year-old justice, speaking to a hushed courtroom, then referenced a friend-of-the-court brief filed in the case. ""One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas,"" he said, ""they come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them.""    Scalia said he wasn't ""impressed"" that the University of Texas may have fewer African Americans. ""Maybe it ought to have fewer. And maybe some -- you know, when you take more, the number of blacks, really competent blacks admitted to lesser schools, turns out to be less.""    Reid took to the Senate floor Thursday to condemn Scalia's statements. Lewis, a civil rights icon who marched in Selma, released a statement saying he was ""shocked and amazed"" by Scalia. ""His suggestion that African Americans would fare better at schools that are 'less advanced' or on a 'slow track' reminds me of the kind of prejudice that led to separate and unequal school systems—a policy the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional decades ago,"" Lewis said.    The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court sit for their official photograph on October 8, 2010, at the Supreme Court. Front row, from left: Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Back row, from left: Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito Jr. and Elena Kagan. Scalia was found dead on February 13 at a Texas ranch he was visiting. – Justice Antonin Scalia was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to fill the seat vacated by Justice William Rehnquist when he was elevated to chief justice. A constitutional originalist -- and a colorful orator -- Scalia was a member of the court's conservative wing. At the time of his death, Scalia was the court's longest-serving justice. – In 2005, Chief Justice John G. Roberts was nominated by President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as an associate justice. After Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, however, Bush named Roberts to the chief justice post. The court has moved to the right during his tenure, although Roberts supplied the key vote to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. – Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. He is a conservative justice but has provided crucial swing votes in many cases and authored landmark opinions, most notably in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. – Justice Clarence Thomas is the second African-American to serve on the court, succeeding Justice Thurgood Marshall when he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991. He is a conservative, a strict constructionist who supports states' rights. – Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, she is a strong voice in the court's liberal wing. – Justice Stephen G. Breyer was appointed to the court in 1994 by President Bill Clinton and is part of the court's liberal wing. – Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and is known as one of the most conservative justices to serve on the court in modern times. – Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the court's first Hispanic and third female justice. She was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and is regarded as a resolutely liberal member of the court. – Justice Elena Kagan is the fourth female justice and is counted among the court's liberal wing. She was appointed in 2010, at the age of 50, by President Barack Obama and is the court's youngest member. On Friday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Scalia should recuse himself from any case before the high court involving discrimination. ""It's so disappointing to hear that statement coming from a justice of the Supreme Court,"" she told Politico. ""It clearly shows a bias."" Janai Nelson, associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, was sitting in court when Scalia spoke. ""My first reaction was disbelief and disappointment,"" Nelson said. ""In a case with this much significance, for a Supreme Court justice to make comments that amplify the myth of racial inferiority, is deeply disheartening."" Scalia's comments have also spawned a protest Twitter hashtag, #StayMadAbby, where African-Americans have posted pictures of themselves celebrating their college graduations. The court does not allow video into the room or any type of live broadcasts of oral arguments and only releases audio at the end of each argument week. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pressured justices to permit live video, with no success. While Scalia's words reverberated outside the legal world, they were familiar to some of those who have been following the legal challenge to affirmative action in higher education. One person who had no visible reaction to Scalia was Justice Clarence Thomas, who rarely speaks during oral arguments. While Thomas and Scalia don't agree on every case, they agree quite a bit. Thomas, the only African American on the bench, has made clear that he thinks public universities should not take race into consideration. He dissented from a 2003 case that upheld the admissions program at the University of Michigan Law school. And as for the lawyer who Scalia was addressing, Gregory S. Garre, he took the question in stride and was quick to respond forcefully. Garre, the former solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, is defending the University of Texas against a challenge from Abigail Fisher, a white woman from Texas who is suing the university arguing she was denied admission based on her race. ""Frankly, I don't think the solution to the problems with student body diversity can be to set up a system in which not only are minorities going to separate schools, they're going to inferior schools,"" Garre said in response to Scalia. Garre has defended the university before the court on two separate occasions. Like others immersed in the affirmative action debate, he likely recognized that Scalia was referring to the controversial ""mismatch"" theory popularized by UCLA law professor Richard Sander and legal journalist Stuart Taylor Jr. in their book, ""Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's intended to Help, and why Universities won't admit it."" They filed a brief in the case, as did Gail Heriot of the University of San Diego School of Law. ""Research indicates that students who attend schools where their entering academic credentials put them towards the bottom of the class are less likely to succeed then similarly-credentialed students attending schools where their academic credentials more closely 'match' the typical student's,"" Heriot wrote. Heriot was not in court to hear Scalia, but she read a transcript of arguments and she defends Scalia's comments. ""He was trying to articulate the extensive literature that shows race-preferential admission policies end up hurting rather than helping their intended beneficiaries, especially in the area of science and engineering,"" she said afterwards. ""We do ourselves a great disservice when we jump all over people for failing to phrase a question in the best possible way,"" Heriot added. The first time the Fisher case was heard by the court in 2012 the justices issued a very narrow opinion and sent the case back down to the lower court to take another look. In a concurring opinion, Thomas echoed the mismatch theory. ""The University admits minorities who otherwise would have attended less selective colleges where they would have been more evenly matched,"" Thomas wrote. ""But, as a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are placed in a position where underperformance is all but inevitable because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete"" he said. Read: Supreme Court declines to take up ban on assault weapons Thomas, and his other eight colleagues all attended elite universities, a point not lost on Nelson, who took Scalia's comment to also be a dig at historically black colleges and universities. ""In additon to denigrating an entire group of students, he also denigrated many of the institutions that have successfully served African Americans when a majority of the institutions in this country would not,"" she said.
