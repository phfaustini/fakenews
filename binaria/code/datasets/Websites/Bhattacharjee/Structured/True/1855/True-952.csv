When asked by moderator Martha Raddatz why his attitude towards Russia’s involvement with the Assad regime directly contradicted Pence’s comments at the vice-presidential debate last week, Trump brushed off his own running mate. “He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree,” said Trump.

Shortly after the debate, however, Pence seemed more than open to reconciliation:    For more Hive coverage of the second presidential debate, read T.A.
