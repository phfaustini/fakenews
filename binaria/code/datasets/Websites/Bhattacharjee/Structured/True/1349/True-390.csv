The presumptive Republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with North Korea, but a meeting with Kim would mark a major shift in U.S. policy towards the isolated nation.    ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" Trump said of Kim.    ""At the same time I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,"" he said in the half-hour interview at his Trump Tower office in Manhattan.    China is Pyongyang's only major diplomatic and economic supporter.    Trump said the United States is treated unfairly in the Paris climate accord, which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than 170 countries. A renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord, committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet.    Turning to the economy, Trump said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks. He said it would dismantle nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.    ""I would say it'll be close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name,"" Trump said.    The New York billionaire also said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble within the tech startup industry. He said tech companies were attaining high valuations without ever making money.    Trump also said he eventually wants a Republican to head the U.S. Federal Reserve, but said he is ""not an enemy"" of current chair Janet Yellen.    ""I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,"" he said, adding that inflation ""doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon.""",1.0
