We're offering up people two totally garbage candidates and then saying, 'OK, what if we made it worse.'""    That's Reason magazine Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward kicking off a new Reason podcast hosted by me and featuring guest Eli Lake, who writes about national security for Bloomberg View.
