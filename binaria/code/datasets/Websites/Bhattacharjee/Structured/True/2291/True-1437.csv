""You have a lot of people from inner cities, especially minorities, who aren't getting higher-level education,"" Eric Trump told host John Catsimatidis on his radio program ""The Cats Roundtable"" on Sunday. ""The schools around them are totally failing them. There's 60 percent unemployment in some of these communities.""    ""We're not giving the youth the opportunities that they so rightfully deserve. My father's going to focus on that, and he's going to change that, and he's going to fix it because it's just not right.    Trump's calls for votes from minorities this week started with his law-and-order speech Tuesday night in Milwaukee, continuing with his mea culpa speech Thursday in North CarolinaÂ  and finished with a trip to the flooded areas of Louisiana on Friday.    The campaign's focus coincided with the addition of pollster Kellyanne Conway as manager this week. There have been reports of Trump polling at 0 percent of the black vote in swing states.",1.0
