The president was speaking Thursday in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of Seven conference, a two-day event focused on the global economy.    “A lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines,” said Obama.
