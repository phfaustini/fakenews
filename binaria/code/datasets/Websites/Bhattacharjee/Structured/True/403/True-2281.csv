Among the frontrunners right now: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.    Pence introduced Trump at an Indianapolis rally Tuesday night and compared him to Ronald Reagan.    ""I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan,"" Pence said of Trump.    According to CNN, a Trump source says that Pence has already passed a major hurdle, noting that his vetting ""was completely clean and that mattered. No one needs an extra hassle.""    CBN Chief Political Correspondent David Brody says Pence is a ""solid movement conservative"" and that most evangelical leaders would support a Pence pick, despite his ""religious liberty misstep"" in Indiana.    On Tuesday, Fox News reported that it is suspending Gingrich's contract since the former speaker is also a vice presidential contender. Gingrich would bring years of Capitol Hill experience to the ticket and has publicly campaigned for Trump for months.    Trump told the Wall Street Journal this week that he's looking for an ""attack dog"" in his running mate. That person would help him fend off attacks from Democrats, the media, fellow Republicans, and even Supreme Court justices.    Meanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken out against Trump in a series of interviews, recently calling him among other things ""unqualified"" to serve as president.    Trump hit back overnight, tweeting that ""Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot--resign!""    Even Democrats have chided Ginsburg, noting that justices historically have kept out of politics.    On the Democratic campaign trail, Bernie Sanders gave his long-awaited endorsement to Hillary Clinton Tuesday night in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It comes after party platform talks, a process that Sanders wanted to influence.    With the platform including a $15-an-hour minimum wage and tougher restrictions on Wall Street, it looks like he did.    For now, with the Republican convention coming up before the Democratic convention, the focus is on Trump and who will be on the ticket with him in the race for the White House.",1.0
