He has just ordered that a waiver be given for the US military to give aid (weapons) to random groups in Syria. This means that ISIS will definitely be getting their hands on some new US guns!! (H/T –RT)   Wikimedia Commons Obama released an official statement about his decision yesterday that read:  “I HEREBY DETERMINE THAT THE TRANSACTION, ENCOMPASSING THE PROVISION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES TO FOREIGN FORCES, IRREGULAR FORCES, GROUPS, OR INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING OR FACILITATING ONGOING U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS TO COUNTER TERRORISM IN SYRIA, IS ESSENTIAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES.”  What the Hell, Obama? Are you trying to help ISIS or are you just that stupid?  Seriously, we have been pumping weapons into the Middle East for decades and look where it has gotten us! It’s time to STOP!!  Hopefully Trump will make it in time to put a stop to this nonsense and save America from 10 more years of WAR.",0.0
