On November 8, Trump was elected US president when he surpassed 270 electoral college votes. Clinton didn’t come close to winning the electoral college – 232 to Trump’s 304 – but she did succeed in securing the popular vote, by about 2.8 million people. But, ”If you take California out of the popular vote equation, then Trump wins the rest of the country by 1.4 million votes,” reports Investors Business Daily. “And if California voted like every other Democratic state — where Clinton averaged 53.5% wins — Clinton and Trump end up in a virtual popular vote tie.” According to Investors, Trump easily won the presidency by every other metric even when California is included: Number of states won: Trump: 30 Clinton: 20 _________________ Trump: +10 Number of electoral votes won: Trump: 306 Clinton: 232 _________________ Trump: + 68 Ave. margin of victory in winning states: Trump: 56% Clinton: 53.5% _________________ Trump: + 2.5 points Popular vote total: Trump: 62,958,211 Clinton: 65,818,318 _________________ Clinton: + 2.8 million Popular vote total outside California: Trump: 58,474,401 Clinton: 57,064,530 _________________ Trump: + 1.4 million After clamoring that Trump would not accept the election results, butt-hurt Democrats have tried various tactics to steal and delegitimize his presidential victory, from calling for an end to the electoral college system, to implementing vote recounts – which backfired – to claiming the FBI rigged the election, to blaming fake news, a cartoon frog, Wikileaks, the “alt-right” and the Russian government.",0.0
