He will be an invaluable asset to our Administration.”  The post will be a return to the White House for Bossert, who previously served as the deputy homeland security advisor to former President George W. Bush. Before that, he spent two years as the White House’s director of infrastructure protection policy.  Since leaving the White House, Bossert has run a national security consulting business and served as a fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on cybersecurity.  Mr. Trump’s transition team said the position for which Bossert was selected has recently been performed by a deputy to the National Security Advisor, but that in Mr. Trump’s administration the job “is being elevated and restored to its independent status.”   Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) will serve as Mr. Trump’s National Security Advisor.  “I am looking forward to working closely with Gen. Flynn as we together help the President-elect advance the interests of the United States and its allies,” Bossert said in a statement.",1.0
