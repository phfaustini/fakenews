4.2 from 15.04.2010
===================
  * Changed license from GPL to GPL/LGPL/MPL which will allow
distribution by some programs that requires spell checking but
does not like GPL such as OOo, Firefox, Chrome, etc.
  * Added about 200 words.
  * Started ChangeLog in English. All documents written before
in Bulgarian will be replaced with English version. Old versions
that are in Bulgarian will stay in repository, but will not be
packaged. Only English version of docs will be distributed.
